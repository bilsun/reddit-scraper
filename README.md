# reddit-scraper
Using PRAW and Pushshift to scrape Reddit for research purposes (e.g. content analysis)--intended more for qual researchers since scraped data is formatted for readability (doesn't prioritize efficiency or scalability)

Analyzing posts: **csv_ALL_posts.py** outputs to **scraped_files** folder when done

Analyzing comments: **filter_files.py** outputs to **filtered_files** folder when done

Walkthrough (applications to download, overview of files, suggested workflow, ethics of web scraping):
