POST TITLE: Open Letter: Dear Apoorva Mehta (Founder and CEO of Instacart)
https://link.medium.com/ubdq67Ytg1[Dear Apoorva Mehta (Founder and CEO of Instacart)](https://link.medium.com/ubdq67Ytg1)

Dear Apoorva Mehta (Founder and CEO of Instacart),
On Sunday, November 3, 2019, through Tuesday, November 5, 2019, Instacart Shoppers will be walking-off for the fourth consecutive year. These three days of action serve as a reminder that our work is absolutely indispensable to you and your company, and central to the continuing daily operations of Instacart. There is no Instacart without Shoppers.

You have a well-documented history of unscrupulous actions against Instacart’s Shoppers. Shoppers around the country organized for the first time in September of 2016 when Instacart announced it would remove tipping from the app’s interface. Our 10% default tip was replaced with a sneaky and identical-looking 10% service fee, which Instacart implied went directly to us workers -- but of course, that was a lie and it didn’t. We organized a walk-off in response to this maneuver and you eventually responded by reinstating in-app tipping with one major caveat: that the service fee remained front and center during the checkout process. The option to properly tip -- which you misleadingly referred to as an “additional tip” -- was hidden.

We walked off again in November of 2017 when Instacart’s “dynamic” commission-based pay model dropped so low that it resulted in some Shoppers earning as little as $1 per hour.

We caught you withholding Shoppers tips and over-charging customers via the service fee in February of 2018. After we crowdsourced the evidence and data of these manipulations, you were forced to apologize and return the misappropriated tips and charges to Shoppers and customers alike.

In September of 2018 you admitted that Instacart needed to treat Shoppers “much, much better.” You said, “we have made mistakes in the past, and we have debt with our Shoppers.”

Not even two months after proclaiming that improving Instacart’s relationship with Shoppers was “a core focus of our company” you instituted the largest pay cut Shoppers have ever sustained. You eliminated commission-based pay -- which paid on an understandable and transparent per-order, per-item basis -- in favor of pay determined by a black-box algorithm. There was no longer understanding behind the amounts we were paid; every bit of pay transparency and predictability we had vanished overnight. The algorithm which determined our pay had no tie to the time, difficulty, or number of the orders we experienced with each batch.

To add insult to injury, your algorithm was programmed to adjust our base pay (Instacart’s contribution to Shoppers’ earnings) downward with each dollar and each cent our customers tipped, resulting in tips no longer being real tips, but rather offsetting Instacart’s contribution to our pay. You reduced our pay to less than $1 per order on orders where customers tipped generously. Shoppers called for and maintained a perpetual soft-strike against Instacart for over two months, refusing orders that fell under a reasonable pay floor. This soft-strike disrupted and impacted Instacart’s batching system-wide to the extent that you could no longer guarantee batch fulfillment and delivery within two hours. Instacart responded by extending delivery windows to an unprecedented five hours, and still, the company failed to fulfill and deliver orders in a timely matter -- if they were fulfilled and delivered at all.

By February of 2019, you were once again forced to publicly apologize to Shoppers and customers. You had to retroactively compensate us for our stolen tips, and recalibrate your pay algorithm to remove tips as a determining factor when generating offers presented to Shoppers. You released a public statement titled “Doing Right By Our Shoppers” while you simultaneously doubled down on this unreliable, algorithm-determined pay schedule, and quietly rolled out another pay cut which lowered minimum our batch guarantees by up to 30%, from $10 to a measly $7 in nearly all markets.

Every year we push back as our pay spirals further down the drain, and Instacart’s valuation swells by the billions, and your net worth skyrockets. When will enough be enough? Because of your greed or inaction, or lack of concern, Shoppers now struggle to put food on the table and a roof over their families’ heads.

You have demonstrated a pattern of behavior as CEO of eviscerating our pay and pirating our tips. It would cost you, Apoorva, absolutely nothing to restore our previous tip defaults to at least 10%. Yet on the eve of our walk-off, you have yet to respond in any way to our demand. You have consistently demonstrated your deep-seated disdain for your workers, you won't even open the door to face those of us delivering your personal orders to your luxe SoMa apartment.
Understand this: You are the CEO, but we hold the power. We are highly organized and more agitated than ever. We stand fully committed to perpetually continue to utilize our collective power unless and until our demands are met.

You launched 20 failed start-ups before Instacart. Whether this will be your first success or your 21st failure will in no small part hinge upon repairing your decayed relationship with Shoppers. Restoring that relationship begins with Instacart acknowledging and meeting our needs and our demands. With the anger of thousands of Shoppers and California’s AB5 both looming overhead, the future of your company rests in your hands, Apoorva.

Signed,
Instacart Workers:

	This is very interesting- actually delivering to cars.   They tested
	it in Mexico City and are rolling it out to Los Angeles and other
	heavy congested cities.  An alert will pop up on Waze when you are
	within 1.86 miles of a Burger King.    * The Traffic Jam Whopper is a
	new initiative developed with We Believers agency.   * The company
	tested real-time delivery in Mexico City and decided to expand    *
	Customers can order on Burger King app and get food delivered right
	to their car

POST TITLE: Some income comps....
I finally got around to updating my spreadsheets, and have a little data to share.  
All in the suburban Chicago market.  I’ve done around 250 orders.

First, running GH, UE, DD, &amp; PM.  PM is almost non-existent, so it is only in overall numbers.

From 2 months ago, running DD only, to now, my $/hr average has gone from $15 (feb), to $20 (mar), to $22 (apr).  Overall, around $20.50, since I began.

This month, so far, order average, by service:

GH $10+

UE $9

DD $6.50

Won’t come as a surprise to anyone that my income - and acceptance rates - go in that order, as well.
