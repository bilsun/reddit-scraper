 Get a call from Diamond! I was excited because it's usually one of the ladies of the night or maybe the strip club! They always tip $20.00, even on a bad night they still give you a $3 tip! I get there and it turns out not to be any of my regular ladies.   
It was 3 beautiful ladies, they were dressed in African attire, looking so beautiful, so many different colors of the rainbow, yellow, red, maroon, burgundy. One of them I could tell had a slight hump back and walked with a limp. I felt bad for her right away because people with disabilities work extra hard. 
 As they got into my car, I noticed that the lady with the humpback wasn't getting into the car correctly. She was literally leaning all the way over but for some reason couldn't put her knees up, I thought maybe it was due to her disability.  
 They all got in, one in the front and the other two in the back, then I asked them their names and ask them to all click their seatbelts. The lady with the hump on her back didn't move. I turned around and I told her ""you are precious cargo, I must make sure I get you there in one piece please click your seatbelt"".   
She had a little waist so I knew it would be no problem to bring that belt down and bring it across your waist. She looked at me funny.   
At that moment she grabbed the cloth of her dress and pulled it around and her hump on her back moved to her side but as it moved to her side it also started kicking! Right at that moment I thought to myself WTF! She had a baby wrapped up in her dress!   
 I looked at her and said ""lady your hump is moving viciously and has moved to the side of your underarm! The lady in the front giggled!  
 At that moment I asked the ladies did they have a car seat for the baby! All three of them shook their heads no in unison. I asked them to please step out of the car and that I could not take them with a baby with no car seat.   
As they were climbing out of the car and I was letting the timer run out I started laughing hysterically and I couldn't stop.
 I got a message while I was waiting it was the lady asking me to hurry up and cancel the ride so that she could call another car right away because I was holding her up.   
I didn't answer,  I just let the time run out. I called CS and ask them to unpair me and let them know about the baby with no car seat and even the little customer service guy begin to laugh at the story. SMDH",N/A,N/A

No one can afford to not pay rent. No one can afford the late fees. We dont have medical insurance. We dont have sick pay or PTO. I get it we are ""independent contractors"" but you deactivate and deny people sick pay that you offered in the first place? How if someone tells you they have a serious underling medical condition could you do that?  DEACTIVATE THEM AND NOT PAY THEM. Your day of reckoning will come Uber and Lyft. And when the lawsuits start flaying after all the dusts has settled you will be begging to pay that sick pay and if drivers start dying on your platform because you refused to pay them and they kept driving.... be ready to see how fast a judge throws out that arbitration agreement. You will be begging to pay what you promised once those settlement numbers pop up.","@ubersupport

These Big Tech companies have been successful in lobbying both republicans and democrats in creating identical “templated” bills to introduce for lawmaking. These templated bills carry very identical verbiage.
A r[eport](https://www.nelp.org/publication/marketplace-platforms-employers-state-law-reject-corporate-solutions-support-worker-led-innovation/) by the National Employment Law Project expresses that the “bills have passed in Arizona (2017), Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Utah (2018). They were defeated in Alabama, California, Colorado, and Georgia.” These templates for state bills are written in a very peculiar manner as they deem all independent contractors as “marketplace contractors” and the “company” (e.g. Uber/Lyft) as a “marketplace platform.”
But this was not enough for the publicly traded companies (e.g.Uber, Lyft, and others). A report by the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/economy/gig-economy-lobbying.html?fbclid=IwAR1nkexBKXsdtV8bWOju1JVSv9V36aztE1Sg9o7aOunttmOyKmFZe1WJqec) explains how a Big Tech Lobbyist by the name of Bradley Tusk started lobbying state agencies (non-elected officials) for rules that prevent “workers” from qualifying for Unemployment Insurance and Workers Compensation Insurance.
### Uber Messed with Texas and They Won
During 2019, in Texas, there was a successful and [secretive operation](https://www.texasobserver.org/are-silicon-valley-giants-responsible-for-a-mysterious-new-texas-labor-rule/) performed by Big Data/Big Tech [Lobbyists](https://www.texasobserver.org/handy-wanted-to-disrupt-texas-labor-laws-it-may-have-also-disrupted-texas-lobbying-laws/). The objective was to strip away Texas Uber/Lyft [drivers’ legal labor rights](https://www.nelp.org/publication/rights-at-risk-gig-companies-campaign-to-upend-employment-as-we-know-it/) regarding qualification to apply for unemployment insurance. As reported [by Texas Observer](https://www.texasobserver.org/are-silicon-valley-giants-responsible-for-a-mysterious-new-texas-labor-rule/) and [expanded by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/economy/gig-economy-lobbying.html?fbclid=IwAR1nkexBKXsdtV8bWOju1JVSv9V36aztE1Sg9o7aOunttmOyKmFZe1WJqec), the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) Chair and Commissioner, Ruth Hughs, now promoted by Greg Abbott to the Texas Secretary of State, seems to have been secretly worked with Big Tech/Big Data [Lobbyists](https://www.texasobserver.org/handy-wanted-to-disrupt-texas-labor-laws-it-may-have-also-disrupted-texas-lobbying-laws/) to rewrite state labor rules (i.e. [TWC Rules](https://twc.texas.gov/files/agency/pr-ch-815-status-test-approved-12-4-18-twc.pdf)).
The TWC rule's verbiage of [“marketplace platform” and “marketplace contractors”](https://twc.texas.gov/files/agency/pr-ch-815-status-test-approved-12-4-18-twc.pdf) mirrors other existing templates and bills which this TWC rule asserts that Texas Uber and Lyft drivers are independent contractors with no labor rights. This successful attempt to bypass state legislation basically rewrote the Texas Law, [HB 100](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00100F.htm) (signed by the Governor Greg Abbott back in 2017), pertaining to Technology Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Lyft. It is important to note that HB 100 was passed in a bipartisan fashion via extensive lobbying and money spent by Lyft and Uber. This rule was a [blatant disregard for the common law](https://twc.texas.gov/files/businesses/form-c-8-employment-status-comparative-approach-twc.pdf), and the rule change was created by appointed seats, not by elected officials.
This new ruling in place prevents a “marketplace contractor” or better to say “worker” from challenging their misclassification as independent contractors at the state's highest courts; via appealing TWC Unemployment Insurance based on misclassification of drivers.

>*The danger here is that businesses can change their business model to conform to these “marketplace” rules and forego any employers’ obligations to basic labor rights.*
After many years of lobbying at the city, [state](http://info.tpj.org/Lobby_Watch/pdf/UberLyft2017.pdf), and federal levels, Lyft went public at a [$24 billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/lyft-stock-how-valuation-compares-to-other-tech-names-at-ipo-2019-4-1028090958) valuation and Uber’s I.P.O. was valued at [$82.4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/technology/uber-ipo-stock-price.html). But is their business model sustainable? For Example, In Houston, a regular Uber worker earns $0.60 a mile and the [IRS depreciates/deducts a vehicle at $0.58 a mile](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-standard-mileage-rates-for-2019). The driver earns a gross profit of two cents a mile. This is not a sustainable or logical business model, its a cashflow model for drivers while the company’s shareholders make a profit.
### 
### The New Gig Act

>*So, what is the IRS gaining from taxes, when the driver is writing off all his or her miles which are two cents below the drivers' earnings.*
This November, U.S. Senator John Thune (R- S.D.)[ a member of the Tax-Writing](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/7/thune-introduces-bill-to-add-certainty-to-worker-classification-rules) Senate Finance Committee reintroduced the [New Gig Act](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/38a75133-d17b-4f56-b115-c9d9e12c218d/7BE74BFDFC4E90C39BD625D6BCD3ED81.ott19128.pdf). It is reported by the [Yahoo Finance that Uber and Lyft ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-lyft-spending-big-bucks-100721856.html)are spending a lot of money defeating the New Gig Act; but bills have a way of starting off with good intentions and eventually conform to corporation “experts” recommendation as the ""shot callers"" for the New Gig Economy. Congress used to have industry experts, but now they solely rely on corporations to be the industry experts and self-regulate themselves which these big tech companies have armies of lawyers at their disposal.
The New Gig Act is also sponsored by Tom Rice (R- S.C.), it is hard to believe the Bill’s summary seen [here](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/bf95aba5-3a6a-4012-b3dc-6d6531d5e329/EEE0ACEAA61960DE697BFA4D9F776BD7.bill-summary-s.-700.pdf) will be tainted on its way up the legislative branch. The [Bill](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/38a75133-d17b-4f56-b115-c9d9e12c218d/7BE74BFDFC4E90C39BD625D6BCD3ED81.ott19128.pdf) seems to favor workers' rights on face value, but these things have a way of changing. So pardon me if I am skeptical and cynical.
Uber and Lyft seem to be heading into an infection point in their business model, and the shareholder will realize that the business model is not feasible. Even the National Labor Relations Board (i.e. appointed seats) [are attacking workers’ rights](https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/) via the peculiar Joint Employer Ruling ([see dissent on page 22](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-19930.pdf)).
Perhaps drivers should list Uber as an employer on their 2019 tax form.


Important Updates:

I generally don’t get the chance to drive in the morning, but when I do, I find people are generally just going about their business. To a meeting, to school, back from the train station. You get the picture. Today was different when I was pinged by the app to go pickup at the hospital. A middle-aged gentleman was waiting outside, which I always appreciate. The uncertainty of driving for an app is always put at ease when a friendly face is standing there waiting for you. The human connection is always nice to see and I much prefer it to a computer telling me when and where to show up.
We started to talk about the weather. The art of small talk is something I believe I have mastered, but my most interesting rides are always the ones that go far past these social norms. The conversation turned sharply as he said that he did not get to see much of the winter this year. My mind rushed to a long-term winter escape. Florida perhaps. So, silly me, I asked away.
“Did you get away for the winter? Lucky you!”.
“No, unfortunately not. I was in the hospital. You see, I had a stroke”.
Knowing very little about strokes or really what to even say, I wished him well in his recovery. We chatted about life, the recovery time, the agony of the doctor’s uncertainty. When could he return to work? Is this even in the cards any more? His entire being had changed in one moment. I suppose life is just a string of how we are doing today, this week, this month, this year. We forget how terrible it used to be when we struggled with a situation or event. With a medical issue, the loss of your first boyfriend or girlfriend, or even how shitty homework was to do in high school. Humans forget too easily and perhaps this is a helpful coping mechanism.

She wasn't handicap or very old, so I was surprised and did so anyways.  And materials see a 1 star.  I think they have been through problems with other drivers so they are hostile to new drivers.

His distance was a $60 distance had it been surge and $27 without surge.  I told him the area is very hard to find a driver since it is one. Reservation far away, so I was under the impression he would actually be greatful for a ride and allow surge like there is no tomorrow.

I picked up some newlyweds from Uptown Minneapolis, and they had another guy with me.  Both guys were huge and can kick my ass if they wanted to, but on with the story 
Woman grabs my charger from my own phone, disconnects it and then thinks she can plug my own android charger into her own phone.  I told her (without yelling or raising my voice that she just grabbed my own charger and that she should ask first) in YouTube video you can hear on dashcam I am playing nice music from my phone and am mumbling music and other stuff cuz it is end of my shift and I'm tired, but the woman started getting defensive as if I offended her when in fact she offended me and she just would not stop talking to me even though I let go of the matter, I was trying to be patient and making sure my own end of shift tiredness wasn't affecting my judgement with this incident that is unfolding for this last ride that took me on very good surge to near my mom's house.  The woman just would not give up so I told her man who is sitting in back, can you please tell your woman to stop talking to me as this isn't her ride and we are do are talking? And then he initially sided with me and he even said ""that bitch show shut up"" he called his own newly wed wife a bitch.   I think alcohol was making her over confident and she wasn't aware I as an Uber can throw them all out in a Jiffy on the cold winter freeway, but I am not the type to strand fellow citizens.  The her man sided with her and told me ""I'm gonna report you to Uber"", at which point I kicked them out and other taller guy with them was begging me to take him when he came to my window, I said sorry man some bad incident occured here so I can't, just crash with them as they brought you along.

I called Doordash and spoke to an agent with a heavy accent. I have significant hearing loss, so trying to understand her was nearly impossible. The best she offered was to deactivate my account, but I don't know if she ever understood that my account had been hacked by a stranger as opposed to me just wanting to cancel. She told me to contact my bank for a refund, which I did shortly after.
In a series of 10-15 emails over the next few weeks, I detailed how I wanted my referral credit back, and that I really needed to speak to someone without an accent due to my disability. This was not to be insulting to any of their employees, but conversations with their staff were nearly impossible for me. Every time I hung up I would burst into tears, and every email I received was generic and always ended with ""we'll get back to you asap!"" Everyone I spoke to had a thick accent, and every email was vague. They eventually began to say my account never existed in the first place....which was frustrating in a way I can't even begin to describe. 
In the end, nobody ever admitted my account was hacked, nobody ever gave me my referral credit back, and I never got a single apology.",N/A,N/A

Many customers are literally living with disabilities, and these types of app services WERE CREATED BY GOD’S Spirit to make their lives easier, and especially to help people living in poverty or on SSI to live more affordably & comfortably.
Just a warning to everyone, the moderator here is a disgruntled Internet psychopath who has purposefully created a community which fosters drivers to complain about Uber all day long, encouraging drivers to literally complain about customers & tips all day long, and to even harass customers for posting here for any “reason” they wish.
The moderator is not a real professional, and even insults & harasses customers for defending themselves against many miserable “drivers” … You know, the random people with cars & a cell phone who decide to take your life & needs into their hands, only to complain about your tips & to harass you for having a voice. These random people with cell phones who didn’t go to college are allowed to insult you, harass you, and gang up on you as well as complain about your tipping system & worthiness to make use of a service that was invented FOR YOU.
If a customer so much as dislikes a single thing about Uber & voices it, they will gang up on them and tell them “THEN QUIT USING UBER NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO JESUS”.  They will try to shame you from using services created for you, insult people with disabilities, trigger you, complain about you, slander you as being someone who doesn’t appreciate or deserve a service that was made for you, and then if you defend yourself the moderator will take these scumbag drivers’ sides loitering the group to insult you & ban YOU.
Think twice about hanging out here, because the moderator is a worthless piece of shit who has created a community of miserable spoiled self-righteous & self-entitled high school dropouts who leech of the Uber business so they don’t have to answer to a boss, fostering them to bully and bash people with disabilities & allowing them to run the narrative & community.
This place is a piece of shit and so is the moderator. Make sure you recognize before proceeding, because I assure this has been happening for years; you can look back in the logs and old threads where drivers are constantly harassing & complaining about customers, then if customers defend themselves the moderator will demonize the victims for his little “frat” hangout while he trolls the Internet behind reddit privileges. He’s a pathetic disgusting lowlife & doesn’t care even the slightest about your rights or feelings.",N/A,N/A

Driver is at least 75 years old, hearing aid and coke bottle glasses, the whole works.
He had no idea where I wanted to go. I literally spent 10 minutes on Google maps showing him where this place is, a mere 5 kilometers away.
Driver has some kind of neurological disorder where he can't press the brake even, only in jerky stomps? Most uncomfortable ride ever.
And I can't pay through an app, cash only.
Kyoto is an amazing city, but I sure wish it had Uber!",N/A,N/A
