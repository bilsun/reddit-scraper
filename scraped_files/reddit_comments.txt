POST TITLE: Why I Now Prefer Uber over Lyft
From a driver in Las Vegas...
I always used to be staunchly pro-Lyft. I actually discovered them before Uber. Lyft did get slow enough for awhile that I was convinced enough to sign up for Uber (I needed money) I avoided Uber for the longest time because of all their negative press coverage (shady business practices, workplace culture, etc) but when I realized how busy Uber was, I began to like it a lot. 
While running both apps Lyft always took priority (unless Uber was surging) because Lyft gets butthurt when your acceptance rate is anything under 100% whereas Uber doesn’t give a shit. Uber also won’t get petty and ping you less if your acceptance rate isn’t so good. Low acceptance rate on lyft? Yeah you’ll have a lot of downtime between rides. 
Uber gives multiple cancellation fees if multiple pax don’t show up on pool rides. Lyft, yeah you’ll get $5 for the first one, but after that, fuck your feelings that’s all you get.
Even with Uber’s flat surge rate, it’s still better than Lyft’s “PPZ” bullshit. Long surge trips still add more of the surge, than Lyft’s PPZ will
Uber also has better quality pax. I used to think the opposite but Lyft pax have gotten increasingly ghetto, low class, trashy, etc (not that Uber doesn’t have those kinda pax, they definitely do but not in the quantity I see on Lyft) 
And lastly, Uber isn’t cutting my pay to 42c a mile this week like Lyft is. I never thought I’d EVER say this, but I now think Uber is better to drive for, by and large
Now of course I’m not trying to sing Uber’s praises or whatever. They rip us off just as much as Lyft can, and this still isn’t meant to be a full time job, and some days can be down right garbage. I’m just saying I finally realized, fuck Lyft

	Lyft cut rates in Vegas again? How unlike them. They usually just
	follow whatever Uber does. $.42 a mile? Lol. That is gonna get a lot
	of scrutiny in the long term. That is under the IRS per mile
	operation cost.

		The change is that they'll pay all miles driven while a ride is
		assigned. That means paying for pickup miles, too. But still...screw
		'em. Those rates are so low they make baby Jesus cry.

			Wow. Yeah they are asking for Nevada to copy CA AB 5 doing that

			Operation Costs as a way to push for regulation like they did in
			NYC. Fucking Lyft is so short sided. They literally are the Target
			of rideshare. Keep messing up hoping that something eventually
			works.

				It depends. If you're in a dense urban setting with lots of
				people, pickups could be no more than 2-3 miles away. However, I
				have been pinged as far away as 20 miles, and with Lyft I noticed
				my pings seemed to be longer than Uber pings. Once got a request
				25 minutes away on Lyft. Declined that soooo fast. Once got a 10
				mile pickup on Uber in a far-out area. Thought it would be a nice
				ride back into town. Nope. Dude was going 3/4 mile down the
				street. He could have walked home in the time it took me to come
				get him.

	I'm really hating Lyft's display of trip data if you have a 90%
	acceptance rate. I have been losing it once a week since they rolled
	it out because one decline can drop you to 87-88% and it takes
	several trips to make that up to 90%. Uber Pro is so easy to maintain
	getting gold status is almost automatic and I never lose seeing the
	trip data.  Both companies should give us this info regardless of
	status, but Lyft's implementation is so much more frustrating than
	Uber's.

	The only thing I like about lyft is being able to see pax destination
	upon arrival. This lets you decide whether it's worth it to give them
	any extra time or not, or even flat out cancel before 5m if you're
	feeling petty and the trip is worthless anyway. I've probably lost
	some decent fares taking the noshow fee with uber.

		I feel this. Sometimes that 5 minute timer takes FOREVER to run out.
		Then you still have to call them. And now in Vegas the timer for
		shared rides is also 5 minutes and you have to call just sucks ass
		If I know I’m gonna make more by canceling I’ll wait the timer out.
		I’ve canceled right in pax’s faces before simply because they gave
		me attitude over the phone

			2 prime examples: **Uber ride:** Yesterday morning go to pick up in
			downtown, could be juicy, could be not. Girl texts me "be down in a
			couple of minutes" oh great, we know what that means. She exits
			with 30 seconds on the clock with a cig in hand that you can tell
			she's frantically trying to smoke down. No luggage, no bags,
			nothing in her hands at all. I wasnt waiting for her to "get ready"
			doing whatever, I was waiting for her to smoke a fucking cigarette.
			Roll out and noshow bitch.  **Lyft ride:** Couple of hours later
			pickup at the beach. Same thing, text when I get there "be down in
			a few minutes". Except I could see they were going to the airport
			and this is about as long distance of a ride as you can expect
			given the circumstances. At around the 45 second mark I see the
			front door open and he's staring at his phone. I know exactly whats
			happening, he's looking at the clock realizing he's almost out of
			time. The guy begins carrying 2 suitcases to my car in an obvious
			attempt to anchor, he's not even close to ready. I exit the vehicle
			and plainly ask him "is it just us?" he says no his wife is coming
			but shes pregnant and slow. I am fully prepared to dump this
			fuckers luggage on the street and drive away if he fucks with me,
			but i'll give him an extra 2 minutes or so due to the mileage.  Sho
			nuff his wife comes out, walking just fine, but with a fucking togo
			container. Bitch was making herself a goddamn snack to eat on the
			way, thats what I was waiting for this time, for her to dick around
			in the fridge and microwave. But because it was lyft I never
			canceled and thus completed the ride with tip so I was satisfied in
			the end.

	away. I'm over halfway there and get a text from passenger saying I'm
	going the wrong way %) notice his name is different...then I realized
	Lyft swapped my passenger. They will sometimes 'trade' passengers if
	another driver is closer. So, I lost out on a really decent trip for
	a $4.57 ride. Fucking bullshit. And I had to drive further to get to
	that passenger than I did the other. And the fact that they never
	even notified me is another thing. Had I not been messaged by

		driver has no employee benefits while succumbing to intense
		micromanagement from a capricious black box.  Their entire business

	uber, and I am not even talking about suburbs which nobody in their

	I agree, uber is better because and only because of less wait time
	between  rides. They simply have more riders( in my area)..so they
	pay less per ride. Lyft has less riders  so the pay more .. at the
	end of the day/week the pay equals out . But doing uber your not
	bored..  but i disagree  with your last part.. if uber did not intend
	on this being a full time gig all they have to do is limit weekly  hr
	simply limit your hours to 12 -15hr a week... both lyft and uber want
	fulltime drivers  but then deny  that they do.  Its a taxi service
	but they say they are a app base service..but in reality the are taxi
	company using app base taxi sofware....What do you think dimond level
	is for uber or gold level for lyft? Its their full time employees..
	both platforms have multiple  levels.. with fancy names but they
	translate like this.  Level1.side gig level2. Parttime

		the rates (.60 per mile) are the same for both platforms currently
		in Phoenix -- so I use both. Some days I get nothing but Lyft ride
		requests-- others nothing but Uber-- and mixes of each otherwise. It
		is never very consistent in terms of who pays better, who has better
		passengers, who tips more, pretty much everything is about the same
		imo-- they might as well be one app. If Lyft decides to lower
		rates-- or Uber for that matter, it will be hard to continue
		offering service. I was already not very thrilled by the current
		situation which is much worse than just 8 months ago and WAAAAY
		worse than it was 3 years ago. I recall people when I first started
		complaining about the rate card etc in 2016 because when it comes to
		this job-- it is just a matter of time before they will expect you
		to work for LESS money. Something has to give--- you cannot expect
		people to work this cheap that are decent at the job. Lyft and Uber
		are going to figure that out at some point-- or maybe they won't
		give a shit and just keep smiling and acting like they are providing
		incredible service. The taxi cab drivers have to be loving this--
		because as our driver population continues to grow with garbage
		drivers and vehicles-- they are starting to look like the upgrade
		service. What we will be left with are the hard up cases who refuse
		to pay much more than a bus ride to get somewhere-- the lowest of
		the low passengers and drivers will be the ultimate outcome.  I'm
		thinking that the only way to approach this is to offer Lux/Black
		Lux and Select level rides. This will definitely be the case if
		either rate card changes. I'll be happy to let the newbs fight over
		the scraps rides as decent passengers will start to figure out the
		only way to get a good car is to pay for the higher level service.
		That is my take at least. I will still give a handful of low level
		rides as long as they take me back to my house while in destination
		mode. otherwise-- fuck both of the apps if they try this horseshit.
		I am not working for them for free.

POST TITLE: No passenger, oxygen tanks, wtf
Received a pickup request like normal. Arrive at the location and it's a medical oxygen place. Guy walks out and says "you know you don't have a passenger right? Just some oxygen bottles". I'm a little confused but I've done a parts delivery and didn't see the harm. I get a text from the customer saying it's going to an auto dealership. Cool. Easy ride and no need for small talk. 
Get to the destination and it's an apartment complex in a shitty part of town(one I've been chased in by random attempted robbers). I call the dealership mentioned and they aren't expecting parts. Text the number through the app. Call the number through the app. Nothing. So I drive the bottles back. Figure 18 miles one way will make for a good payout at least. 
The gas company calls their customer (the one who ordered the bottles) and he says yeah they are supposed to go to an apartment complex. I tell the guy what's happened so far and he gives me his personal info to call him when I arrive at the complex. Note: I'm the second driver attempting this run. The first one noped out. 
Get close to the complex and the app sends me a text from the CX telling me who to call to come get the bottles. I try. No answer. I text. It's a wrong number. By this time, I already have a ride behind me with surge pricing so I'm ready to be done with this shady shit. 
I follow another car into the complex and leave the bottles in a shaded area by the building of the recipient. Text my customer again and they say ok fine thanks. 
So I close the job. 
A few minutes later I get a call asking where I left the bottles etc. Told him I left them in the grass in the shade (its Texas so I didn't want to leave them in the sun on hot concrete). He gripes at me about how I'm supposed to leave tanks a certain way and I hang up on him. He calls back and I tell him not to call again. 
I did everything in my power to provide good customer service despite the shadiness of the situation. On the bright side, made 50 bucks.

	Uhhhh... you might want to look at your state or local laws. That
	might actually be illegal. Pressurized oxygen tanks I think is
	classified as "hazardous" material, and signage has to be posted when
	transporting. Since you are on the clock you are technically
	"commercially driving", I'm not sure, but I know whenever oxygen is
	moved they have to have the diamond signage on vehicles when
	transporting such material regardless of the size of the vehicle. I
	would look into it. Hope you are okay but something to consider.

		Yeah, carrying medical oxygen is regulated by both DOT for

		Requires hazmat certification, marking, and shipping/manifest

		of the local cab companies that also runs a rideshare service has a
		specialized rideshare/medical transport operation for explicitly
		these reasons. I'd turn the company in to the DOT in your state if I

https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/8189gd/pulled_over_for_picking_up_prostitute/
POST TITLE: Pulled Over for Picking Up Prostitute
So about 2 months ago I was in a slightly shady neighborhood picking up a young black woman.  She was dressed rather nice because she was headed to a company holiday party downtown so she was showing a lot of skin.  She texted me and said she would be waiting at the curb.
I pulled up and and she got in the front seat.  We barley got a few blocks and I got lit up by the police.  I was sure I was not speeding so wondered what the issue was.  
The police officer did not ask for my license, he just wanted to know how I knew my passenger.  I proceeded to explain to him that I was just an Uber driver taking the young woman downtown.  I don’t want to speak badly of police as I do respect them, but I was speaking to the most naive cop on the planet that night.  I showed him my phone with her name on it, then showed  him my stickers on my car but he was still giving me the third degree.  He was also very rude to the girl telling her to shut up any time she tried to speak.  I would have thought this was an easy thing to figure out and be done with but the cop seemed like he thought I was using Uber as an angle to pick up hookers. 
He finally got her out of the car and spent  about 5 minutes talking to her. Could not hear the conversation but her body language was pretty aggressive.  
So after he was done talking with her he came back to the driver windows and told me to go on ahead and don’t pick people up here anymore.  To which I replied.  “ I will pick people up wherever they asked to be picked up, that is how Uber works.”  I realize that the area is not the greatest but it was far from a horrible part of town.  I am not sure if he heard me correctly because he just smiled and went back to his car, which is fine by me as I was expecting my back talk to be met with a much more aggressive response. 
The girl got back in my car and I finished the ride.  We talked quite a bit about having a good story to tell from now on.  She was a real nice girl and felt bad that cops thought she was a prostitute, but she seemed to take it in stride and we had a laugh about the whole situation. 
I do understand that seeing a guy pick a girl up in a tight dress with cleavage hanging out looks fishy and I had no issue with the cop pulling me over, but once he found out how wrong he was he became a bit of an ass and I can’t stand that.  A quick, sorry for that guys would have been enough for me, but he decided to issue an ultimatum instead.
So that was a fun night, has anyone else ever been pulled over for something similar?

	I think a cop thought I was kidnapping a young woman. I know where
	they sit on the expressway just north of the city so I made sure I
	was going precisely the correct speed, turned the brightness down on
	my phone and dash so it didn’t look like I was texting (and because
	it’s distracting up where it’s so dark away from the city), and I
	actually had the music off because the lady was on and off of phone
	calls. But she sat directly behind me, which always seems shady. So I
	pass the cop and he instantly pulls out behind me and starts
	following. He followed until she got another call. Her phone
	brightness was all the way up so I’m positive he saw her answer the
	call, thus confirming she wasn’t being held hostage. I told her to
	thank whoever called and told her what had happened. She completely
	missed it all.

	Closest I had was last St Patrick's day, when I had a guy who really
	had to pee. I wasn't super familiar with the area we were in and
	drove towards a gas station but as we got close we saw it was closed
	(it was like 1:30am) so he told me to just pull into a CVS parking
	lot and he got out and went to pee behind an auto parts store. As
	soon as he starts taking a piss, a cop pulls in and flips on his
	lights and I'm like "You've got to be kidding me", shortly
	thereafter, 2 more cops pull up, so now there are 3 cop cars sitting
	there for dude taking a piss behind a building with no one else
	around at 1:30 (oh and it's even raining).  The guy was super
	apologetic and just told them the truth that he was drunk and had to
	pee and I was his Uber and he had told me to stop, and after 10-15
	min they told us to go on. He gave me a decent tip for the waste of
	time and I got a decent story. Funniest part to me was that his
	apartment was literally like 3 min away and it had been like a 20 min
	ride to that point plus we wasted a couple min pulling over for him
	to take the piss, so I'm honestly not really sure why he couldn't
	just hold it in for another minute or 2. \\\_(ツ)_/ drunk people, but
	at least he didn't piss in my car. I did also have my own hooker
	story, but that was just some whore going from one hotel to another
	across town "to get something from her sister" while on the cell the
	whole time trying to set something up with a customer. It was almost
	funny how robotic it was. "Hey Baby, you want to party tonight? Yeah?
	It will be $300 ..." just down her list of regulars. Stupidest thing
	was that I was still pretty new to Uber and actually waited on her
	and then took her back to the first hotel, although in my defense she
	didn't really start making the phone calls until the ride back, it
	was pretty slow, and I was fine waiting a few min for a fare back
	across town.

POST TITLE: An awesome end to the evening
I’m headed home last night, around 1:30 and I get a ping at an apartment complex less than a mile from mine. I pull up and pax is waiting outside. Older gentleman, between 60-70 I would guess. He sits up front with me, is very chatty and also extremely wine drunk. He had been at a Beatles cover band show and needed to go to Wal Mart which was only a 5 minute drive away. 
We arrive at the Wal Mart having had a pleasant exchange on the short ride. He asks me if I would be willing to wait for him, he’d be 5-10 minutes max. I told him no problem, he was a cool enough guy, just told him when he got back to my car to request another ride and it would ping with me. He goes inside, does his thing, and is back in 7 or 8 minutes. All he went in to buy is one “for sale” sign like for a garage sale or something. Weird but whatever. He has his phone out and is having trouble in his state working the app and asks “could I just give you cash for the ride back?” Normally I wouldn’t even entertain this idea, but it was on my way back, I didn’t sense anything shady so I was like sure why not. I drop him off, and he thanks me and hands me a 50 dollar bill. I was like “sir this is a 50”, just because he was obviously impaired, and he insisted. He thanked me again and went on his way. Probably the easiest 50 bucks I’ve ever made. Good times.

POST TITLE: Uber Cheated Me Out of Consecutive Ride Bonus
I did a consecutive ride bonus yesterday. As I'm about to finish the first ride, I get a request for the next one. I hit accept, and got a message saying "An Unknown Error Has Occured. Please try again later." I had full network coverage at the time so that was not the issue. I get a request immediately after without the consecutive trip in the details. I called support and gave them all the info and they did not do a god damn thing. Uber is such a shady company, they only seem to have technical errors when it involves paying out bonuses. It was for a $11.50 bonus and they pretty much robbed me of it to fool me into driving into traffic to start the first ride. Seriously fuck them.

			Verizon) is I can reliably re-connect to the network by turning on
			airplane mode for five seconds and then turning it off. For some
			reason this seems to jolt the app “back awake” and it reconnects to
			the network. The only issue is it causes the consecutive rides
			streak to vanish. So now I’ll do the airplane mode trick before I
			end the ride I’m on, so I can give it the jolt while I’m still in
			transit. That way I’m reconnected by the time I end the ride and
			ready to receive another ping. I wouldn’t be able to explain the

POST TITLE: Really Lyft? One Shady Lyft Passenger left feedback Wedneday., Today, Friday night as I'm heading out to drive, Lyft locks my account in order to 'resolve' the issue?
Why I'm Sitting Here on A Friday Night When I Planned to go Lyfting... (hint: shady PAX left feedback) 
I get dressed, I get my bottle of water, my podcasts are all set to go, I go to the Lyft App and I'm met with this:
https://imgur.com/C43fHq5
So anyway, this shady drug dealer (note: may not have actually been a drug dealer, just shady) accused me of being high and now late on Friday, I get a message saying that my account is locked until they resolve a safety issue. Really? There is so much to discuss here, not the least of which is why Lyft waits until Friday night, and how exactly do I resolve a crazy accusation which is so utterly and completely false, as to be laughable.
1. Why did Lyft wait until Friday night? This could not have been mentioned yesterday or early on Friday when I might have had a chance to straighten things out. Now what? I assume the people in charge of this won't be back until Monday.
2.  Now I'm thinking, even if Lyft does resolve it, so I can still drive this weekend, I'm thinking I don't want to drive in those areas of town anymore,
3. Apparently anyone can say anything, and based on the shady people I pick up late at night, I need to buy a dashcam so I can record every single trip. How much does that even cost? Anyone have any good experiences with particular brands of dashcams?
4. Goodbye weekly $425 guaranteed bonus. I won't be able to meet the minimum rides now. Thanks to 1 passenger, and notification on a Friday evening.
5. After the last update, the ratings/comments timer expires too quickly, otherwise, I WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTING THIS GUY. That's the irony. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PASSENGER IT IS, because I have a perfect record. (i think) and this passenger began complaining (more like muttering/rambling) before he even got into the car, and was complaining about my route the entire trip. In either event, how do I leave feedback after the timer expires? Doesn't seem to be any way to do this. This needs to be fixed stat!
6.  No. I was not high, in case some of you are wondering. It's like, I'm thinking this is just plain insane, now I have to convince someone that I don't do drugs?!?! I barely even drink! How is Lyft going to 'resolve' the issue? How exactly does that work, they talk to me on the phone and figure out if I sound high? I come in for a drug test? It's just plain absurd. I'm so mad right now.
7.  Passenger was super crazy acting the entire trip, stunk of cigarettes and was talking super fast. I should have just stopped the car and asked him to leave, but I was worried about keeping my ratings high. I guess no more bonus for me, I'm not picking up anymore passengers in downtown Atlanta. Done.
(I could tell the entire story, but I'm nobody is interested in the details. Suffice it to say, it was one of those rides. I knew it would be when the stench of cigarettes made it's way to the front of the car.)
**So much for a perfect driving record, perfect reviews, and loyalty. I must be the only moron who only drives for Lyft exclusively, because I had some crazy notion they were a good company which supports their drivers.**
/end rant
----------
update: AND... **What happens to this PAX?** I mean here he is making a 100% false statement, which has cost me money, what will happen to him once this is resolved? Will his account also be suspended? Probably not. This is just gets crazier the more I stew on this. Literally, I need a dashcam now. I'm losing my faith in my people here. Who would do this and why?
r/TaxiConspiracy... (lol)
**Could it have been a set up?**
The area I picked him up from had a bunch of Taxi's sitting on the street, like 20 of them! Could this be one them sending in fake passengers just for the hell of it and leaving fake feedback. The passenger complained the whole way, and I smiled and apologized like a trooper, and then he point blank kept asking me if I was high in the car. LIKE wtf?! 
Like I WANT THIS INVESTIGATED! (...it won't be, I'm not dumb, just mad) **People don't just make statements like this for no reason.** (It should be a given that NO I was not high) So If we assume I'm sober, then why would some sketched out guy leave feedback, just for the hell of it? Doesn't make sense.
So I guess, now I'm an uber driver too.... what a life.

			comment score: 7 | u/None
			Well, let's clarify some things.  Again, I am technically one of
			those "crooks at the top" in your mind, as I'm a company owner. But
			there's a lot of misconceptions out there. Firstly, most taxis in
			America are small businesses or owner-operators.  A handful of taxi
			kingpins, large fleets, and loudmouthed taxi unions have fucked
			things up for all of us.  What they say, do, lobby for, and want is
			*not* reflective of the majority of *even other owners*...let alone
			drivers (including their own). Secondly, the medallion system is
			really only prevalent in a handful of major cities.  The majority
			of us don't have to deal with it, and we all think it's horseshit
			for a number of reasons.  What people don't realize is that while
			yes, *some* unions and kingpins wanted that system, the government
			is the biggest entity to blame for it...along with their
			constituents/voters who cried for it...based on safety, congestion,
			price controls, etc.  People seem to think we all *wanted* to be
			overregulated into oblivion.  That couldn't be further from the
			truth for most of us.  It's bullshit and we all know it...and it's
			one of the biggest reasons for the industry's downfall. Thirdly,
			you grossly underestimate the incompetence of the government and/or
			airport boards and managers.  I've had to deal with my own share of
			similar clusterfucks due to airports trying to change shit and
			royally fucking it all up for cabs (*cough*  Denver International
			Airport *cough*).  Again...hold off on the conspiracy theories; we
			have to deal with just as much...if not more...bullshit as y'all
			do. Anyway, point being that *generally* even the dirtiest of taxi
			moguls is not going to take the time (and money) out of their night
			(and bank account) to hire somebody to take a few fake Uber/Lyft
			rides and ding their rating or get them locked out. *Especially*
			not in this day and age...where every dollar and every minute
			counts, and it's a race to see who can avoid negative press the
			most.  That's some trivial, petty, counterproductive shit, and a
			waste of time (considering how many RS cars are on the road)...at
			least to the majority of guys (and gals) I know. This isn't South
			Africa or Brazil (where taxi guys will literally blow up suspected
			Uber vehicles, lol). Sure, there's a few taxis here and there
			that'll fuck with Uber/Lyft guys, but the reverse is also
			true...and it's really not that widespread besides. I'm a member of
			a LOT of taxi groups/forums/etc...and you guys would be surprised
			how many of us there are that are actively trying to keep the peace
			and prevent retailiation, bad blood, whatever...and are trying to
			reform cabs in general. I personally have zero tolerance for
			cabbies...drivers or owners...fucking with rideshare dudes. You
			just finally got stuck with a weirdo, man.  Lol.  Happens to

				that to find an address? There is an XYZ on the corner of THIS AND

				"...okay she spouts off some address which sounds right and says

				is my taxi still coming? where is it?" **taxi dispatch:** "he's

				**me:** "WTF!? there is no F-ing 7-11 near here. Are you f-ing

				Do you drive in Atlanta? It's kind of Atlanta Airport specific.
				Basically, everything was fine, uber/lyft drivers drove from a
				special waiting area to the passenger pickup lanes and picked up
				their rides. Then for no apparent reason, the airport morons
				decide, "oh no no, let's do this instead. now you will instead of
				picking up passengers at the passenger pickup area, you will now
				have to drive through the Airport parking lots, get a ticket like
				you are going to park your car, and pick up your passengers
				there." So, you have: 1. People Parking, Looking for Parking,
				Leaving, etc...  PLUS 2. A crap load of Uber/Lyft drivers
				frantically trying to find their passengers before they are in the
				lot too long and charged for parking. 3. There is now an endless
				line of traffic  because that's not what the parking lots were
				designed for...  Just use your imagination. Taxi's are unaffected
				and even get a speical lane, just for them to pick up passengers.
				That's what I'm on about.

	on my rider app even though surge is over and if I were to force
	close the app and open it up 2 seconds later there is no surge. I've
	notice this happen because I go between rider and driver app when
	driving. The surge will be long gone on my driver app but still be
	showing up on rider app unless I force close rider app. This probably
	is what happened and passenger was charged the normal fare and not

	I drive a 2012 Hyundai Sonata SE edition 1. Is it true I have to
	change my rotors EVERY time I change my brake pads? (They said
	they're too thin to resurface, and if I don't get new ones the new
	pads will squeal from the start)  2. They say my rear left tire needs
	an alignment, is $130 a good deal for that?  3. I hear a "whub whub
	whub whub" sound when on the freeway but only when turning to the
	left, and I can feel the vibration in my floor. I'm guessing it's my
	wheel bearing in my front right tire, does that sound right? When I
	drive with my windows down and near a wall to my right, I can hear a
	tingly metal sound from the right side, which I'm assuming is the
	same wheel bearing? Dealership offered $400 to change, bad deal?  4.
	I changed my transmission fluid at 98k miles, is this OK? (I heard if
	you wait too long you might as well not change it, but is 98k too
	long?) 5. I use cruise control very frequently, even on surface
	streets and to accelerate the car when I hit 25mph, to optimize fuel
	economy. I average 28-30mpg, is there any downsides to using cruise
	control all the time? (damage wise to the car?)

		1. Ideally. You can have the rotors turned down (ie smoothed out)
		but it's not going to save you all that much. If you want to extend
		the life of your brake pads and, thus, your rotors, buy ceramic
		brake pads.  They're a few extra bucks but last significantly
		longer, are quieter and create less brake dust. 2. An alignment on
		four wheels typically costs about $125ish, so you're right there. 3.
		"whub whub whub whub" = wheel bearing 99.9% of the time.   $400?!
		Terrible deal, my friend.  Terrible.   A quick search showed the
		retail cost of your hub assembly/bearing at around $40.  This can be
		changed with standard tools (a jack, a ratchet & sockets, some rags
		and a few ounces of grease) in your driveway.  If you have any
		mechanical aptitude or a helpful pal, an hour and a safe place to
		park, you can do this yourself.  Send me your VIN and I'll link you
		to the exact stuff you need. 4. 98k is fine.  Better to change it
		late than never. 5. Relying on cruise control on surface streets is
		typically inadvisable because your reaction time is reduced.  There
		is no mechanical reason to avoid using cruise.

		To add to the mechanic's reply: Cruise control won't hurt anything
		mechanically, but you should never use it in inclement weather. It
		can cause serious problems if it tries to accelerate on slippery
		roads. Newer systems may turn off if they sense something that isn't
		right, but that's a pretty big risk to take. I rarely change or
		resurface rotors unless they are cracked or distorted. The little
		grooves in the surface will wear the pad to conform to them, and
		that may take a few miles off of their life, but they usually aren't
		expensive enough to worry about it. If the grooves are too deep,
		they may be thinner than the tolerance at that point, so need to be
		replaced.   Distorted rotors (out of true) will cause vibration.
		This is caused by uneven heating/cooling, and can indicate serious
		problems. You can't just grind them flat. They need to be replaced.
		Even if they are good, replacing them is cheap insurance against the
		possibility of having your rotors made brittle from overheating.
		Now, grooves in a rotor are usually caused by pads that wore down
		too far and began chewing into the disc. That isn't good, but it's
		not necessarily a death sentence to the rotor. What it *could* do is
		cause that brake to be more effective than the others because of the
		increased surface area, which would cause the car to pull to that

		and full of leaves?  Without enough air, combustion can't occur. 5.
		Intake manifold gaskets.  If extra air is leaking into the cylinder,
		the air:hydrocarbon ratio may be too lean, causing incomplete or no
		ignition. 6. Camshaft position sensor.  If the sensor is reading
		inaccurately, your timing will be thrown off causing a rough idle.

		comment score: 3 | u/ChokSokTe (OP)
		The wobble is likely from the wheel being unbalanced, not an
		alignment issue.  Take your car to a reputable shop and ask them to
		balance the wheel.  There is also the chance that the wheel could
		have been damaged.  How long were you driving on a flat? A
		difference of a few PSI makes no discernible difference.  If it is
		over inflated, you wear out the center tread of your tire faster.
		If it is under inflated, you'll wear out the edges faster.  There
		could be some handling issues with a very large discrepancy, but
		something that large would be visually obvious.  When you're having
		your wheel rebalanced, ask them to check your tire pressure.  The
		balance should cost you no more than $15 or so, depending on your
		location.

		There are four main indicators for when an alignment should

	Hey My 2015 Prius has a “maintenance check” on the dash. I’ve driven
	11,500ish miles since my last maintenance check. According to Toyota
	I’m suppose to get my car checked every 5,000 miles and they charge
	me $300 ish for every 4 maintenance checks. I haven’t went there in
	months because I don’t have money for maintenance checks, my car
	seems to be doing fine. How do I know when it’s absolutely necessary

		That’s tough. Dealerships are financially incentivized to keep you

		sites, asking your friends & coworkers where they tend to bring
		their cars and even to cold call shops. If someone isn’t willing to
		speak with you and talk you through a concern or repair, move on.
		In the meantime, cautiously visit the dealer. Ask them if things are
		needed or simply suggested. They’ll give you the truth if you press

	2013 altima (good uber vehicle?), power windows acting up. Whenever I
	use the drivers side master control switch sometimes my windows get
	stuck and the LED's on the switch go out, making me think the switch
	block itself is bad, especially since this happens intermittently.
	Now I just keep the windows up all the time. I was told it could be
	the BCU? Body control module I believe, some other computer component
	that interfaces with a variety of systems including how the power
	windows operate.  Here's the thing, when the master switch fails NONE
	of the windows can operate, even from their own switches. It's like
	every window ceases to function just because the drivers side fails.
	Now that it happens to be functional at the moment I noticed that the
	drivers window makes a horrible clicking sound like the motor itself
	is struggling, meanwhile the other windows operate normally.  So to
	summarize: when drivers window fails the other windows fail.
	Sometimes the other windows work but the drivers side makes funny
	noises. Sometimes the LED's on the switches go out on the drivers
	side indicating failure.

	Great service to the community thank you and please stick around. Any

	. Multiple cars, never drive one more than 2 consecutive days for
	uber . Drive only Toyota, less than 7 years old (replace by 8th year)
	. Normally avoid 9am-5pm but hits rush hour a lot . Regular
	maintenance, tune up 30k miles, etc.  Yet I find I still have trouble
	with shock, balance, and brakes, happens waaaay too early compared
	with not driving uber (20k vs 50k expected for example), seems to be
	unavoidable. My last car died within 35k miles, 150k miles odometer
	when died, probably because it was a not so obvious lemon from a used
	car dealer, felt great for the first 10k miles then
	suspension/balance/ac (somehow it always start with ac when car
	starts to die) and finally gasket.

		comment score: 2 | u/ChokSokTe (OP)
		I’m not sure why AC is always in the first to go, but you’re right.
		Buy ceramic brake pads and rotors. They’ll cost a few dollars more
		but last longer, are quieter and more reliable.  Be sure to rotate
		your tires.  I recommend my customers do it every other oil change.
		Don’t be afraid to ask them to check the balance (or get beads).
		When replacing parts always replace with OEM grade or better,   The
		extra $ is worth it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/6vz50w/how_about_a_waiting_for_passenger_option_for/
POST TITLE: How about a "waiting for passenger" option for people who want to make stops?
People who want to make stops is a very common thing and all of us hate it. There are those irritating riders who believe they're entitled to any stops they want to make, but there are also those who don't feel comfortable with the idea because they don't want to waste the driver's time. So I'm wondering if there's a way it could work. One idea I have would be:
- A "waiting for passenger" slider that shows up during the trip, either underneath the "Confirm Dropoff" slider or in the waybill panel.
- Sliding would immediately up the per-minute fee to something like $0.50 per minute. Not an outrageous charge, but still enough to make it worth the driver's time. Rider pays and driver receives an extra $5 for a 10 minute stop at Starbucks, a bank, or wherever.
- Once GPS detects you've started moving again, "waiting mode" automatically turns off and resumes the normal fare charge. This would be convenient, and prevent any shady drivers from trying to enable the higher per-minute fee without the rider realizing it, resulting in higher fares without justification.
In the end, pax are more satisfied because they can make stops, and drivers get the equivalent of $30/hour to just chill in their car. How many of those 180 days of change do we have left lol?

	I'd think about it for $1/min. But I'm still opposed because at least

	at the drivers discretion.

https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/6zk7ab/my_first_time_giving_a_ride_with_uber/
POST TITLE: My first time giving a ride with Uber
It's a long story, but gets progressively more and more crazy as it goes on.
I drove down further south in salem, OR than I'd ever been and down a long driveway to a fairly nice looking house at about 3pm. No one was out front so I called them, and I heard a phone ring from inside a kid's backpack that was sitting on the ground knocked over in the driveway next to a really torn up soccer ball. I figure they went inside for a second and will be back out so I wait for a couple minutes, then I wait a couple more minutes and consider telling the app they were a no show, because literally no one is around who can see me and the phone ringing in the kid's back screams horror movie to me. Despite the shady vibe I was getting, I got out to go ring the door bell, immediately dogs start howling and a woman's voice pierces through the other noise screaming "shut the f*** up rodney!!". I immediately regret my decision. 
As the door swings open, a small army of dogs, each about the size of my foot, swarms out and around me. One of them jumps on top of my foot as a platform and tries to jump up off my foot and try and bite me, but only makes it to my knee. The fifty something screaming women calls off the dogs and seems very annoyed as I tell her that I'm an uber driver and am here to pick up someone, we'll call her cassie. She slurs under her breath that "she'll out in minute". Out of the dogs now swarming under her feet jumps a cat that beams like convict during a prison break out of the house. I'm like "oh is he suppose to be outside?" and she ignores me and starts shouting "jerry get the back in here you rat's a**hole". Each step she walks out, the cat takes two steps further away from her and as she approaches the edge of the concrete turning into dirt, she stares at the cat and the cat, now underneath a car, just stares blankly back at her. I offer to help her get the cat back inside, but I'm ignored for another full minute of blank staring back and forth between them. Then she just turns around, shrugs and says "naw he got his freedom for now" and I just awkwardly laugh, but am just going wtf inside.
She goes back inside and I go back to my car and wait. Then the same women stumbles around the corner of the house from the back and grabs the small child's backpack and gets in my car. I say "so you're cassie, right?" and she says "yeah uh huh" and I'm like "ok".. as I say my prayers and turn out of the driveway she leans in close to me and says "by the way, I'm reeaally f*cked up right now, just so you know" and I manage to breath out an "oh ok... let me know if I can do anything to make you more comfortable" and she says "can you turn that music up?" and I turned it up pretty loud, and she turns to me and says "naw you gotta blast that s***, son" and as I turn it up to a deafening volume she starts full tilt dancing in the passenger seat, screaming along to the radio "I like to throw my hands in the air sometimes, saying HEEEEEY OOOH!!!!". She sings along to every song as we go, and as I'm driving I keep catching her looking really intently at me, and then she starts gesturing for me to dance along. I try to tap my hands on the wheel and sing along to a couple words to appease her, but the second I stop, she stares again and then gestures more, and eventually starts elbowing me in the arm as I'm driving to keep me dancing with her. I try to concentrate on driving but am forced into dancing and singing along with her.
As songs get quieter, she mentions to me that she rents out rooms in her house to "cute college kids like me" and how she "loves each and every one of em", "$500 a month, in case you're interested". I'm dying at this point and squeak out an "I'll think about it" through my teeth. Just then she gestures to the right and says "ya're suppose to turn there!" and I looked at my gps and it said we were heading straight for several more miles and told her that "the gps will take us to the right place if you put it in right on the app." She relented and said "I wanna go to the liquor store, so longs as you get me to a liquor store, we not got to have no problems". I wasn't sure if that was some vague threat, but she then followed it up with "if you take me to the telsher, I'll give you a biiiiig tip" and I said "excuse me what was that?" She repeated "if you take me to a telsher, I'll give you a tip." After having her repeat it 3 more times, I was able to work out that she wanted to go to a "teller" which actually meant an atm, she then got ridiculously excited as "Sugar" by Maroon 5 came on and the forced dance driving resumed.
After about 20 minutes of driving across town, she throws her arms up and says "where the hell are we going?" and I point to the app and show her that we're going to where she asked to be taken, and she protested "naw man there's a liquor store right next to my house, we need to turn around" At this point, we're almost downtown so we stop at a different liquor store, completely ignoring her address that was all the way across town that she put in when she called me. She goes into the liquor store, about 30 seconds later she stumbles out with huge bottles of tequila, rum and a 24 pack of Coors light. I confirm that we're heading back to her house and she nods. Just as I pull away she shouts "waddabout the telsher?" and I contemplate whether I wanted a good tip or just to get this ordeal over with sooner. She says she "really want to give you a big tip" and I sigh and turn into a chase. I watch her walk up to the atm and look very very confused. It took a minute before she even put her card in, which she did at least 10 times afterward. She began swatting the atm on the touch screen with her palm over and over again, by this point a line had formed behind her and a lady seemed to ask her what the hell she was doing, then walked inside in a huff, the drunk cassie looked nervous and slinked back into the car, breathing "naw they wont give it to me", and I just say "it's alright, you can tip me in the app after the ride if you want" and she says that she definitely will and that she's wants to give me an extra big tip for being such a good sport about this.
On the way back she says she has "3 daughters that are all smoking hot, just like their momma" and begins bragging about her California king mattress and her flourish that she'd "be happy to give you your tip along with a couple drinks and a good time if I wanted to come upstairs".... I didn't even have the words at this point, and just said "nah, I'm ok". She really didn't like that and just stared daggers at me the rest of the way back. As she grabbed her stuff to get out, she leaned over and told me to give her a kiss, but bent her head down like I was suppose to kiss the top of her head, which had visible dandruff and hadn't been washed in at least a few benders before this one. I'm f***ing horrified and at a complete loss as to what to do, and I awkwardly lightly tap the top of her head with two fingers and make a kiss sound with my lips. She looks up with her face less than an inch from mine and just stares at me for what felt like minutes, I'm 99% sure she knew that kiss was bullshit and I don't know what the fuck she's going to do. Slowly she just pulls away and out of my car, I tell her to have a nice day, and she clicks her teeth at me and walks away.
I pull out of the driveway and stop a little ways down the road to just reflect on what the hell just happened. I look over at the passenger seat and there's a big wet circle on the seat. This bitch pissed herself on my passenger seat. Was that why she wanted to tip me so bad? Or did she do it at the end when I declined to prostitute myself? I cleaned that shit up, and got the f*** home. The ride lasted over an hour and a half, I made $22, and no she didn't leave a tip.

POST TITLE: This is the perfect weekend to strike against all of Uber's Shady practices and demand to be treated better. We deserve that.
This is the perfect time for all us drivers to stand up for ourselves. Uber is having a bad few months, and after the tape of the CEO degrading a driver over his concern of constant fare decreases, this is the perfect time to stand up and demand more! It's not being greedy, it's demanding to be compensated for what our work is worth, the depreciation of our cars that we don't realize until way down the road, and the expensive high mileage maintenance that's coming our way. 
If you agree with this please spread this message around. I am an Uber driver who wants to be compensated and treated better than I am.

	Now take into account that AAA estimates it cost $0.55/mile to drive

https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/72b51a/i_have_a_question_for_uber_drivers/
POST TITLE: I have a question for Uber Drivers
Apologies if this isn't the correct forum to be asking this but I figured this was a good place to start. I called for an Uber at 4am and was accepted by a driver. I sent that driver a text message explaining where I was, as per what I do with every driver. After that text was sent, I got a phone call from "Uber Support" claiming that in order for them to send out this driver, they needed to confirm my identity over the phone. This lady asked for the correct spelling of my last name, my date of birth and finally my payment card number. Thankfully I did not give out this information, I work in customer service. I called for another ride. The same shady driver accepted my ride, but then immediately cancelled it. I got picked up by a different driver, who didn't contact me at all. 
Am I to assume that outside of the driver themselves, no one from Uber is going to call me? I guess I'm just looking for what the proper channels are in contacting Uber to let them be aware of this.
Again if this isn't the correct subreddit, I do apologize. Thank you in advance

	This is a scam - for drivers (they try to steal your pay) and for
	passengers (they order rides on your dime) Uber will never call you,
	they have your info in the app. If you still have that drivers info,
	please report them.

	comment score: 16 | u/SFUber
	Yep, sounds like a scammer to me, probably set up a driver account
	with false information. Do you have a record of either request in
	your trip history? I'm guessing not. So be careful about filing the
	report under a trip with a real driver as Uber bots may automatically
	deactivate an innocent driver.

						comment score: 3 | u/Sirefly
						I have about 10 VoIP numbers linked to me from Uber. (It used to
						be one.) Every ride I take, I contact the rider through one of
						those numbers. I don't know if there are 10 numbers total for my
						city (that seems impossibly low, and I have no idea how that
						would work) or if the ten numbers are assigned to only me, or if
						10 drivers and I share those numbers, but the numbers have
						stayed the same for at least a year. I think the riders get a
						different set of numbers so they never even see my VoIP number
						when I contact them, only their own. I only see mine when they
						contact me. The numbers stop working for the drivers as soon as
						the ride ends (or changes), the number for the rider will work
						for up to an hour after the ride ends (so the rider can contact
						the driver if they left something in the vehicle.) So calling
						the VoIP number from a different phone will not work. The
						numbers are set up to connect from or to the actual phone
						numbers for a certain amount of time. If someone left their
						phone in an Uber and wants to contact the driver with a
						different phone, they have to contact Uber customer service and
						customer service will make it so the new phone can contact the
						driver, but it might not be through the same VoIP number the
						driver had during the ride. I don't know how it all works, but
						it seems the scams have to happen while a ride is active. The
						driver scams, and now this rider scam, seem to only be
						happening after a ride is requested.

			deactivates it.  This is the first time I’ve heard of it happening
			on the driver’s end though. My hunch, it was a long time driver,
			got his info compromised.  His login info got bundled with a bunch

			If someone scammed a driver to get into  that driver's account,

			bonus, and ask the driver to give them the 4 digit confirmation
			code sent. The 4 digit code is actually from the Uber website and
			the scammers are trying to log in to the driver's account. If
			successful, they can change the password, steal the driver's
			current earnings and, more importantly, sign in as that driver on
			any other device. There is a 72 our wait before the scammers can
			withdraw the driver's earnings when changing account info, so the
			scammers must be trying to get credit information from riders now,
			I doubt a driver for 3 years would pull such a scam, so their
			account is likely compromised. Please alert Uber and tell them.
			The driver might still be logged into their original device and not
			know their account has been hacked.

POST TITLE: 10 Things For Riders
I was thinking this weekend about a few things I'd love to tell some of my riders.  Thought I'd share!  These are in no particular order of importance.  Add your own! 
1) If you or anyone in your squad feel sick let me know please. I'm prepared for that. I have a bucket, a cool towel, mouth wash, baby wipes, antiseptic wipes, and hair ties. I've got you. I've been there. Just let me know so I can make your ride as safe and "oh yay I didn't throw up in my hair or on myself" as possible. 
2) I don't need directions. I've lived in my city my whole life, I speak English and can read all the signs, and it's 2015 who the hell doesn't have a smartphone.  
3) You don't have to apologize for your's or your crew's behavior unless you're abusive, destructive, or unsanitary. It's ok if you're loud and obnoxious. I'm glad when people are having a good time. And I'm THRILLED you made the responsible decision to get a safe ride. Don't feel bad. 
4) I can fit 4 people in my car. Four. That's one, two, three, four. Please please please consider the size of your party when you go out and allow for the extra money it will require to go Uber XL.  You'll have a more comfortable ride, and, more to the point, you'll be in compliance with safe driving standards.  
5) Please have the address of where you want to go loaded in or at least let me know the name of the place when I ask.. which brings me to..
6) If I ask you a question or make any request at all please do me the courtesy of responding and/or complying. The only time I ask anything of anyone is for your safety. Seat belts are not optional with me. I will ask you to put them on every time, even if we're only going a couple blocks away. 
7) This hasn't happened to me but I have read several stories so I feel I have to say it... It is never ok to be sexually suggestive or to touch your driver. We're there to transport you safely, not to be played with or put up with your poor choice of "jokes". While we're glad you're out and having a good time, please treat our relationship as a professional one. Treat us the way you'd treat your doctor, lawyer or financial adviser. Some of us might actually be those things and only drive part time as a public service. Being a trashy woman who gropes her male driver because "he's a guy he doesn't mind" is inexcusable. Yes they do. They very much mind. And saying tasteless misogynist things to a female driver is pathetic. Sexually harassing a driver only ensures that the good drivers leave the market. Make no mistake that Uber is about bottom line. If they can't get quality drivers they'll start to slip on their background checks to keep drivers on the roads. Do you want some shady asshole driving you around? Your girl? Your mom out with her ladies? No. Didn't think so. Watch your damn mouth and keep your hands to yourself. 
8) You have to be pretty bad for me to give you anything less than a 5 star rating.  I had a lady barf all over the side of my car and I still gave her 4 stars. I'm forgiving. I want you to be able to get safe rides if you're not abusive, destructive, or unsanitary. Please have the same consideration for me. Until I yell at you, offend you, or put you in danger, please rate me well. 
9) Please give a quick stomp of your feet before you enter the car if you've tracked through a dirty path. Every little bit helps me to maintain the cleanliness of my vehicle for riders. The cleanliness of my vehicle is important to me because it assures your comfort. And your comfort and safety are our primary concerns.  
10) Thank you for choosing to drink responsibly and not drive!  Seriously, you're making a positive impact on drunk driving related incidents. Your fares are a small price to pay for lowering the amount of people lost to poor decisions.

POST TITLE: CBS News reports on Uber, Lyft shady campaign to Try To Stop Proposed Law That Defines Drivers As Employees


	comment score: 16 | u/XJadynX
	Be careful what you ask for / Demand. You might not like it when you
	get it. Everyone thinks what uber is saying is a joke. It's not. If
	you are classified as an Employee, then you will be treated as such.
	No more logging in or out when you want. You will be given hours to
	drive and you will have to drive them or be fired. No more picking
	which rides you want, you'll HAVE to take what rides are sent to you.
	a HUGE amount of drivers will be laid off due to the fact uber will
	not be able to afford keeping as many people as are on the app right
	now.   Yes, regulation needs to happen. Better pay, chances for
	benefits, not being suspended or put deactivated on a whim or false
	report. However, being classified as an employee is NOT one thing
	that needs to happen. Go on, call me a shill, Call me whatever you
	want.. just remember if this does pass to come back here and look at
	all these threads again of people warning you about this and how you
	laughed at it.. all while you sit there being told what to do.. if
	you're not let go because of it.

		Who gives a fuck if Uber or Lyft try to force work schedules on us.
		They know damned well the flexible work schedule is the big draw to
		being a driver to begin with, they're bluffing. The law doesn't say
		a damned thing about work schedules, we can be employees and still
		have identical work schedules we have now. I don't buy all this fear
		mongering from pro 1099 drivers. And it's not like we have a choice
		when to drive, there are certain times of day and week where these
		are the only times you can make a profit, especially in smaller
		areas like mine where time between rides can be long.

			But you would definitely lose the ability to choose your own hours.
			Otherwise anyone could just log on at 2am  in the middle of nowhere
			when there's no work and collect minimum wage without having to do
			any rides. It would only make sense for them paying a minimum wage
			if they could say when and where you had to work. They're not

						You did not answer the question of why we have labor laws in the

						bottom line in a big way, and the main attraction to doing Uber
						is in fact the free work schedule

				like uber will make sure to work out every advantage they can to
				make their point. Sure you won't be abused, you'll get your
				minimum wage.. and it'll be minimum. You'll get your benefits and
				pay for them straight out of your minimum wage. Those benefits

POST TITLE: Trip payments are missing from our accounts conveniently a day after Uber announces they lost over $5b last quarter.
Pretty ironic that the system is losing trips again isn’t it? Usually when their POS system is behind paying out trips they at least show as “processing” in your driving history and show up a few hours later. I’m missing 3 from today and there’s no record at all of them ever having happened except the screenshots I started taking after the first one. “Support” says they are looking into it but stopped responding once I sent screenshots. This company is shady AF!

POST TITLE: Not sure how I feel about how Uber is handling my insurance claim.....
Thoughts??:  
I was driving with a Pax and got hit by another car. No injuries, pax was close to his destination so just got out and walked the rest of the way and I ended the trip. I reported the accident to Uber, and the other driver's insurance, as I firmly believed it was his fault. Of course he said it was my fault. Police came and wrote no tickets, but it was near a government facility so there happened to be video of the accident. I took pictures of the resting place of the vehicles, damages,  the lines on the road were clear so it was easy to me to see the other guy was at fault. 
Uber (Actually James River Insurance who does their coverage) took about a week of review and said the police DID file an internal report which they have, and had video to support: Accident was my fault. I was shocked, I could not imagine how it could have been my fault. O.K fine, I suck. I did the phone based app to take pics and submit damages to JR for review. The other guys' insurance sent an adjuster dude to take pics too. I figured since it was my fault I wouldn't hear anything from them. I took the dadvan to a few body shops for estimates which were all within $200 of $7000. 
Took Uber another couple weeks to only offer $4700, with my deductible allowed only $5700 toward the repairs, and I footed the bill for the rest because I was just done arguing with them about it. I couldn't go any longer without a vehicle. They said take it or leave it, so I took it. Dadvan got fixed, picked up dadvan, dadvan is happy. 
About a week after I picked up the dadvan I get a check in the mail from the other guys insurance company for $6800. WTF, I called them and they said it's for the repair.. Our adjuster looked at it and said that should cover it. I said I don't understand, Uber already paid for the repair and I picked it up since it was my fault. Their agent said: Umm, no, it's clear from the pictures of where they came to rest, your diagram and the video that our insured was at fault, regardless of what the police report says... cops make bad judgements all the time, no biggie. We were glad to see you took such good pics and that video was available, we want to make sure the appropriate person is faulted even if it is us. We told Uber we accepted 100% liability WEEKS ago. The she then said however: don't try to cash the check, Uber just contacted us recently and said since they already paid out on this, they get the check, so we had to cancel yours and send it to them. They should be refunding your deductible. 
SO I called Uber asking WTF why didn't you tell me. They said they just deal with the other insurance so I don't have to and once their check clears they will mail me my $1000 deductible. 
Here's what does not sit well with me:   
1: Uber NEVER told me the other guy's insurance accepted liability. I would MUCH rather have used their check to fix my dadvan and save me that extra $$$$ beyond my deductible. 
2: I could have had a rental car while my dadvan was down and being fixed, paid by the other guy's insurance. 
2: If they get that $6800, and not just reimbursed for what they paid out.... Uber\JR is going to MAKE $1400 on me after they pay me only the deductible back from the check they receive from the other guy's insurance. 
Does this sound like some sort of shady or illegal shit?
OOh,  I should be getting some payment from the other guys' insurance for my lost uber earnings for the month my dadvan was out, so I have that going for me.

	I guess I'm "lucky" in that I have more experience dealing with auto
	claims (6 or more over the years, only 1 was my fault).  It always
	makes sense to contact the other person's insurance company, as
	you've now learned, and you would have been in a rental the next day
	most likely. In fact it's surprising they didn't call you to get a
	statement, which means it was an open and shut case.  And this --
	that it was obviously the other party's fault -- really makes it look
	like James River did this on purpose, sending you a lowball check in
	hopes that you'd never know they were getting a bigger check from the
	other insurance company. *Note that the other insurance company had
	already spoken with James River*.  Multiply that $1100 profit by a
	few thousand claims a year and you have a hefty case of fraud. I'd
	contact your state insurance commissioner/regulator. It's important
	to document these type of practices, because then the states will
	compare notes, and if they find patterns [they will bring
	suit](http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/05/18/life-insurance-
	lawsuit/). There are some links here, but I found they aren't all up
	to date: https://eapps.naic.org/cis/fileComplaintMap.do ... so you
	may want to just google "[STATE] insurance complaint" The good news
	is there are more things you can still claim from the other party.
	It's far from too late, and like I said, I've had experience with all
	of these: * Just because you didn't have a rental doesn't mean you
	aren't allowed to claim that expense. Seriously. There's a per day
	allowance usually. * And if you had any additional expenses, they
	must pay for those.    * Loss of income is a legitimate claim in your
	situation.    * Injuries -- aches and pains? They have to pay for
	chiropractor and acupuncture, not just traditional medicine.    *
	Diminished value. If the dad van was worth $15,000 before the $7000
	of work, it is probably now worth less. They have formulas, but this
	is likely another $1,000 or so.

POST TITLE: First Really Rude Passenger EVER
So I am a very part time Uber driver. I’ve been doing it on and off for almost five years in two states as a side hustle. So tonight I am on for about three hours. I get a ping from a woman. She messages me through the app and tells me I am picking up a gentleman by the name “Dylan” and then proceeds to give me his number. 
I respond OK. And I head to the address, an apartment community, did look kind of shady. I park by the address, and I text the number from my google voice account and tell him “hey, outside..” and a few seconds later he calls the number. I didn’t get the call because I don’t have push notifications on. But I promptly call back. I tell him I am here. My vehicle description. Etc. and he basically tells me that he walked all the way to the front of the complex for nothing, he calls me a F*cking idiot that wasted his time, and goes on a rant. And that he saw me leave the complex, which I didn’t. I end the call, cancel the trip since I was waiting well past five minutes, and get out of there as soon as I could to avoid any conflict. He then texts me and says-
you’re an idiot. 
P*ssy
F*ggot
I reported him to Uber and hopefully the woman that requested the ride loses privileges to use Uber now. Which I doubt will happen. Uber will probably reverse the cancellation fee knowing how they treat their riders. Why are people such assholes? And why don’t people have common sense on how to use shit like this? I know this really isn’t that bad of a situation, but Christ.

		she said she was cold so told her to feel free and play with the
		controls. So she did and she was amused with that. Lol. I started
		the trip and it was about a half hour ride. All highway. Mostly
		silence. She tried to talk but she spoke very broken English but she
		was very friendly.  Anyways- I got to her location; a spa. I dropped
		her off out back and her friends were waiting behind the business. I
		unloaded the groceries. I guess they were cooking some meal. And as
		I was walking out she handed me a $10 bill. So that, on top of the
		$25 ride. Well worth it in my book.  Then I had to deal with that

https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/ddps73/why_do_so_many_drivers_prefer_lyft_to_uber/
POST TITLE: Why do so many drivers prefer Lyft to Uber?
The Lyft app is absolute garbage. Say what you will about Uber, at least they built a functioning app. I've compiled a list of infuriating issues that I have only experienced with Lyft.
1. Trying to refuse a trip when you want to stop driving is ridiculous. So many times I've been driving, and either because I notice that its surging on Uber, or I just want to be done for the night, I try to turn off the Lyft app. But before I can flip the switch, I get a request for a ride. I hit the x to refuse the ride, but before I can move my thumb half an inch to turn the app off, I get another request. I've had chain requests like this when I'm trying to log off last up to 4 times, plummeting my acceptance rate at no fault of my own. 
2. GPS issues with pickup and drop off. And I don't mean just finding the passenger, I'm pretty good at finding addresses even when the GPS is incorrect. What I'm talking about is that YOU CAN'T START OR END A TRIP UNLESS YOU ARE AT THE EXACT LOCATION LYFT THINKS YOU SHOULD BE AT. I've had instances where I've had the passenger IN MY CAR and could not start the trip because Lyft doesn't think I've arrived yet. Its very awkward trying to explain to my passengers why I have to drive around the block before I can start driving towards their destination.
3. Insanely long pickups. With no long pickup fees. It seems like Lyft has to make up for their lack of drivers by increasing the radius that a driver can receive ride requests from. I am consistently getting 20+ minute pickups to the middle of nowhere, even when I'm in the heart of the city. With Uber my pickups are rarely more than 10 minutes away, and almost never more than 15. And I actually get paid extra when they are.
4. Seemingly random Prime Time. I've sat in Prime Time pink zones for 15+ minutes more times than I care to count. If there isn't anyone requesting rides, why are you charging customers extra? On the flip side, Yesterday I  was so insanely busy with Lyft, that for 4 hours straight, as soon as I would pick up a passenger, I would get another passenger auto added to my queue. Almost every passenger complaining about how long it took them to find a driver. No Prime Time whatsoever. After that 4 hours I get curious and check Uber, and the entire city is drowning in a red surge sea.
5. Bullshit rules regarding cancellations. One time I arrived to a pickup location that was literally just a road with walls on both sides. no buildings, no place to park, to passenger. So I get the feeling this is just one of Lyft's GPS issues and I call the passenger to find out where he is. He has no idea. after 5 minutes on the phone with the guy and circling around the block trying to find him, we discover that he entered the wrong address. I look up the new address and its about 10 minutes away. I was in a good mood, and the guy on the phone was really nice so I decide to still pick him up anyway. I get to the new location and the guy is nowhere to be found, wont answer his phone, and because I'm now 10 minutes away I can't tap "Arrive" to start the timer. I cancel the ride, call support and they tell me I'm ineligible for a cancellation fee because I did not tap "Arrive" on my phone. They say that in the future, if  I cant find or contact the passenger I should just tap "Arrive" and wait 5 minutes to collect my fee. Here I am, literally going ABOVE AND BEYOND to try and provide a good experience for customers, and they screw me over on a technicality and their advice is basically "Try being shady AF next time"???
6. Annoying audio cues. I have the navigation set to silent. I have my phone on a mount and have no problem navigating by taking a quick glance at my route every couple minutes. But every time I get another passenger added to my queue, and the robot lady mutes my music and says "New Lyft rider added to queue" I want to blow my brains out. I'm fine with it once per ride, but every time the rider in my queue cancels and I get, or Lyft switches riders on me it has to notify me again "New Lyft rider added to queue". After the 4th time my passengers are like "Wow, you must be busy tonight". No, the app is just poorly designed ma'am. Lyft already doesn't give me any information whatsoever about riders in my queue, why do they feel the need to tell me every time it changes, it literally makes no difference to me.
7. Popup message when near destination. I cant think off the top of my head what the message says, but everytime I make my final turn on to the street the drop-off/pick-up is located on, some message appears on the top of the screen, obscuring the actual address number I'm looking for. Yes, Lyft, I know I'm near the destination, just show me the damn house number I'm looking for. This is especially annoying when the location is the first or second house on the street, and I have to just stop in the street for a few seconds to actually find out what driveway to pull into.
8. Double messages. Every time a passenger sends me a text with useful information, Lyft sends their own safety message reminding me to pull over. I never text while driving, but I can read messages that show up in a notification at the top of my screen without taking my hands of the steering wheel. however, because Lyft is so concerned about my safety, they send me a second text that clears the message with actually useful information and forces me to grab my phone, close the Lyft app, open my messages, and scroll to the message the passenger sent me. Instead of doing all that, why not just let the passenger know that the driver has seen their message, but because they are DRIVING they should not expect a message back. And if you truly cared about my safety you would move messaging in-app and read it out loud for me like Uber does.
By contrast, I could probably use the uber app in my sleep. 
Every time a Lyft passenger says to me "I only use Lyft because all the other drivers tell me its the better app for drivers, and I just want to support drivers" I die a little bit inside.

	though it was dead.

	I have to agree on this one, I usually do uber, but due to all the
	rage I read about I try out lyft sometimes.  but god damn I hate the
	lyft app.  First of all, no night mode, bright white screen.  Also,
	every single damn time I try to pick someone up with it, the location
	finding is hell, it forces back to the app itself and has a
	absolutely terrible map of the location, with a 300 ft radius
	sometimes on their location.  Wind up calling them.  They won't
	answer half the time because 'what is that number'.  so you text, if
	you can, if not driving (if downtown there isn't anywhere to stop, so
	it's basically a cancel incoming if you can't be bothered to answer a
	call when you know someone is looking for you)  That and every single
	passenger (except in Galveston, they've always been close to where
	they say they are there, but it's a special place that has very
	specific places people like to be) is never where the pickup location
	says they are. No in app messaging, all done through a text
	forwarder, they rarely if ever even give a little message (like I'm
	in front of the wingstop). But I mean it's mostly the no night mode
	(so I have to crank my phone brightness down pretty hard) and pickup
	locating issues.  also, uber has this nice little (I'm holding up a
	"your color" light on my phone) built in.  also requires fewer
	physical touches, uses slide to confirm instead of multiple buttons.
	Don't know about the passenger side. Uber also sometimes has that
	'data' call option, and everytime I ask a passenger about it, it
	shows up as 'uber' instead of 832-blah-blah, so it has that going for
	it, although the uber data calls sometimes don't transfer to my car's
	handsfree, but I'll still take it every time because they almost
	always answer if they want to be picked up. However, that being said,
	if uber is being dead I'll still turn lyft on to pick up more trips.
	but the app could stand some improvements, for drivers.  post-note:
	In the greater Houston market, lyft and uber basically pay out the
	same (.60 a mile 12.5 ish a minute, doubled for xl, etc) but other
	markets are heavily skewed to 1 certain side, so my experience will
	definitely not match yours.  maybe if I had started on lyft first
	uber might be that weird side app, but my only complaint with the
	uber app (besides location being wrong, but its usually only off by a
	corner of a block or 2 houses), is that the night mode 'auto switch'
	doesn't work, and I have to force close the app and reload it
	(doesn't go offline when I do that on android at least).  I'm sure
	people who signed up with lyft first probably think the uber app is
	weird and stupid. The large number of lyft amps (glowstaches for
	some) says both sides are doing well here, for now, as long as they
	don't try the crap I'm hearing about elsewhere here.  We're all out
	here to make a buck, so high five as we pass. this is a side job and
	i'll go with whatever gives me rides and money, so they both get my
	business. =p I guess that and I sometimes have uber comfort rides
	available, which has a better minimum fare. and lyft has a really
	bitchy popup when you don't want to drive 20 minutes to do a 3 minute
	trip, where uber is like well you do you. and the button presses...
	\_4\_ required to pickup someone, I'm here, comfirm here, pickup,
	confirm pickup.  on uber its... we already told them you're here,
	slide to start ride.  I've never accidentally ended because you have
	to slide to end the trip where lyft is 2 more buttons, when that
	drop-off (if downtown) is probably roadside in traffic and you have
	to get moving.  it's all the app, like most of it.  (except for other
	markets where its ' all the app, and also the rate sucks ' ).... hate
	on uber all you want, but they at least spent money building a proper
	app.

	I used to run with both on. I actually found out that I made more
	money with just Uber on than with Uber+Lyft, counter intuitive as it
	seems. Now I only use Lyft when desperate.

	i prefer Uber instead of Lyft. i live in Atlanta and i know my areas.
	Whenever i’m by a 5 Star hotel, the majority uses uber. I’ve also
	notice that i get tons of airport rides than i ever would with Lyft
	but the biggest thing that stand out for me is when i use Uber, i get
	the feature that shows who far the distance is. Lyft never gives that
	option but if they did there’d be more competition

	I’m not sure about the poster but in my market it’s the opposite. I
	prefer lyft over Uber. Uber sends me rides that are like 10 miles
	away or 20 minutes. Lyft is usually within 5 mins or 3 miles. After
	sometime lyft will be slow and Uber is the way to go and only
	accepting rides that are close.  As far as gps I find them both to be
	around the same.  Double messages never have gotten that before.  It
	may just be your signals and your area that make your experience like
	this. It just varies from person to person

	Sorry, I quit listening after, they steal the surges.  Also, going
	only Uber has made me run almost non stop all day.  God help me if I
	have to take a piss break and decline a ride, what was a non stop
	ride-a-thon turns into ghost town.

		Yeah and you also have to drive further to get to that trip, and
		deal with a slew of inefficiencies with the Lyft app.  I should
		clarify, my complaints are with the app specifically. I don’t know
		which is the better company (or at least the less shift company),
		but Uber’s App is hands down light years ahead of Lyfts app
