And women are given psychiatric medication for pain at a much higher rate than men.  
As a first responder it wasn't unusual for EMT's to assess women for mental conditions before treating them for pain.  It also wasn't unusual for EMT's to question whether women were exaggerating their pain because of course, women are more emotional and neurotic than men.  Men are strong, stoic and reliable when talking about their pain, so if a man says he's hurting, get him some pain meds stat because it must be serious.
The biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women.  This must be why women access medical help more often than men?  But the truth is, women are not rewarded for being proactive about their health.  They're stigmatized as being dramatic and emotional attention seekers.  Whereas men are brave and stoic and only access help when absolutely needed.  
Just because the medical community targets women in ads doesn't mean women or girl's are treated well once they try to receive help.  Women are targeted for monetary gain because they know women are more likely to access help which means more money for hospitals and doctors.  The myth propagated by men's groups that the medical community just loves and cares about women more than men is laughable in the face of studies done in regards to the different treatment men and women receive. 
I'm interested in hearing feminist's thoughts on this subject.  How women are treated by medical professionals and why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to, when studies show the exact opposite.",">The biggest myth I see in progressive men's groups like menslib and alt-right groups is that the medical community ignores men and caters to women. This must be why women access medical help more often than men? 
This is something I've noticed as well. I rarely say anything because this is still their experience and if they feel they are having difficulties accessing medical support I want them to have it. I only say something when I feel they want women to take a backseat in their favour as that causes harm for us. 
The other issue to mention is that women tend to need to go to more appointments before getting a diagnosis. I've also heard mothers complain that if they take their child to the doctor alone, the doctor will assume she is overreacting and not take the child condition seriously. 
>why it's such a common myth that when women enter the medical system that they're needs are catered to
I think it comes from the fact that men have a shorter life expectancy than women, and tend to have poorer prognosis for sex neutral cancers. These are probably the things that are discussed the most. Things only AFAB people deal with are rarely discussed and are often misunderstood with the exception of breast cancer. 
Breast cancer is another thing that is often brought up to argue that the healthcare system doesn't cater to men. Breast cancer treatment has improved significantly in recent years and has a huge campaign.",114

I then told him that the reason I was bringing it up was because I had been reading a lot of first or second-hand accounts of close encounters with human traffickers, intending to start a discussion about how scary it can be to be a woman sometimes. He quickly got excited and started hypothesizing about all the ways human traffickers might control their victims. It started to sound like he was giving me a lecture on how human traffickers use emotional control and power dynamics to control their victims, when he hadn't done an ounce of research on the topic. I didn't like the feeling because it seemed he was taking an expert stance on something that he knew nothing about, instead of asking me more questions about what I had read. I interrupted him and told him I would rather hear his theories after he had done research, and he asked me to let him finish. I then told him it felt like he was mansplaining to me, and he got annoyed, laughed, and said ""So, now everything I say is gonna be mansplaining? I'm trying to participate in the conversation."" I got pretty pissed and basically told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore and he left my house, then sent me some texts continuing to say he was confused by my accusation because he really thought he was adding to the discussion. 
I am really struggling to figure out how to discuss this with him. I told him that I would have preferred a different response to my accusation of mansplaining. I told him that instead of dismissing me and laughing, he could have gotten curious about why I felt that way, explored it a bit and tried to repair it. He responded to that by telling me that *he* felt dismissed by the accusation. 
He has told me that he considers himself a feminist (because he has women in his life he cares about), but when I try to talk about toxic masculinity, implicit bias, or anything of that ilk in relation to him, he tends to scoff or get defensive.

So I was officially diagnosed as Autistic last year, when I was 18. My councillor wasn't too surprised about this news and had suspected I had something undiagnosed.
The thing is, I've expressed concerns about my mental capabilities during the time I've been around them. (I've been seeing this org since I was 14), and wasn't until I was 17 they've decided to pursue a diagnosis of some kind.
I specifically talked about my lack of focus, frequent dissociation and struggles in academic environments and subjects. This wasn't just a off mention, I talked about it a lot during sessions, and talked to multiple people (teachers, school councillors, social workers).
I was wondering if my late diagnosis  could be due to the [discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_in_medical_diagnosis), in that, I was not taken seriously or pushed away because I present as a woman and/or am a PoC. 
TL:DR ***despite expressing concerns throughout the years, I was only diagnosed last year. Was wondering if this could be due to gender of racial bias***
Thanks and apologises for any mistakes.","There is definitely a gender bias when it comes to the diagnosis of autism as well as ADD/ADHD in women and women-aligned people. A big part of it is that medical professionals look for symptoms that typically manifest in boys and men and do not recognise that these conditions manifest differently in women.   
Diagnosis is also harder for adults in general , since most stereotypical cases of autism and ADD/ADHD are diagnosed when one is very young.",118

I have no bias or malice, and won’t comment unless asked. I want to understand, from a feminist perspective, what is *causing* the objectification of women’s bodies in society.","Patriarchy turned women into child-bearing commodities, so for roughly six thousand years women have been objects traded and valued for their inherent quality of having uteruses. Women are valued by men as brides to give them offspring, as having ""their own"" offspring makes men more socially powerful -- historically it made men richer as the owner as child slaves, and in modern times men are rewarded with career advancement and social approval for adhering to the masculine norm of being a ""family man"" and provider.
The cause of this objectification was men's need for paternity, which continues to exist today in marriage and family laws which highly center men's paternity as important for a host of legal rights and obligations. This centering of men's paternity and control over children for land inheritance purposes resulted in laws and social norms restricting women's sexuality to ensure men could know who their offspring were, making having sex an extremely fraught and socially dangerous thing for women to mostly try to avoid (but not for men) and something women would generally be shamed for if they had sex or behaved sexually in a promiscuous way.  This creates a sexually adversarial system for men and women, where men have no or little social repercussions for having sex and seek to have it, while women have often massive social repercussions for sex which they need to navigate carefully. This leads to an overall atmosphere and culture of sexual obsession, which results in not only sexual objectification but also sexual repression and stigmatization of LGBTQ sexualities and expression.
So I'm going to go with ""the cultural and legal significance of paternity, the continuation of shame-based restrictive cultural attitudes toward women's sexuality and sexual behavior, and the perpetuation of the two parent family child-raising structure"" as the cause of women's objectification.",189

For example : internalised misogyny, where 'Pick Me' women will dismiss feminism and attempt to undermine your attempt to educate about how X term or concept is oppressive - what's worse is there'll be a man who'll tag-team with the 'Pick Me' too, so you end up on the losing end of the sexist and woman with internalised misogyny dog-piling. It's frustrating and disheartening.
You see this across all axes - when black people talk about anti-racism there'll be 'house n*****' blaming other black people for police brutality or calling for respectability, when working class talk about poverty there'll be other working class people repeating propoganda about people on benefits, or this post was inspired by a thread dealing with another Autistic person using ableist terms against Autistic people (I was subsequently tag teamed by her and a guy who works with disabled people so thinks he knows best). Sigh. 
It's just so frustrating being stuck in that situation, where people are so willingly prejudice and ignorant towards their own communities. 
Does anyone have any effective strategies for dealing with people like this? 
Also how do you avoid talking over a minority or skidding out of your lane when in the middle of an argument the other person reveals they are part of X group you're discussing?","This may come across as a bit rambling, but the thing I am trying to outline is not clear cut.
Are they being complacent or are they refusing to see themselves as being a victim?
Life is difficult at times and everyone has to get up in the morning and get through the day... almost regardless of what happened to them in the past. In this context an individual may need to see themselves as not be a victim of oppression (regardless of the historical record) but the master of their own fate... they may need this narrative to keep them going in life.
A friend of mine was raped. She, however, didn't go to the police... because she didn't trust them to be able to help... but also because she couldn't (as she described it) allow herself to be a victim. This was entirely separate from what happened, but because she was young, capable and had a goal... for her accepting the status of victim would have changed her. She is the person who walks with confidence into the unknown and takes the bull by the horns. She obviously knows what happened to her, but she has her life to live and in that cannot accept 'victim of rape' in terms of the psychological needs of who she is/wants to be.
Here my point is: the person you are speaking to is also an individual with their own personal life to live. They have a journey they are on, and in this they need to see themselves as being able to take on the burden of that journey. Here the history of racism might be something that would make their personal journey unbearable, so they (for reasons of their own psychology) have to see it is an event of history, but not an event that effects them and their journey.
Remember the facts of history and the psychological narratives of self do not necessarily align. The narrative of self is the story we need to take on the day and journey of our life, that need can trump the facts of the matter.
Do they deny history, or are they focussed on the story they need in order to succeed as they see it?",56

making sure to take breaks and rests
While youtube and twitch have their official processes for dealing with harassment , reporting moderating censorship, muting, banning people

My focus for this post was how to deal mentally and emotionally level with actions, techniques
Feel free to reply on how you deal either in it general or individual issues I’ve listed bellow
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Fake donations. Men who demanded my attention in chat and make me feel guilty about not replying or reading immediately.
Lack of communication or chat interaction without face cam. Insults on looks when I do have face cam.
One my biggest issues is that I don't get taken seriously, also I'm not traditionally attractive. Like I enjoy wearing low cut tops, like even when I'm not streaming. Like I try really fucking hard but this is difficult because of my mental health.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
Not taken seriously, sexism, etc pretty much from the get-go. There are people on Twitch dedicated to harassing female streamers.
My successes are attributed to my gender instead of my hard work and talent
. A handful of loyal viewers who feel the need to defend or carry me, because I’m viewed as fragile and not \*as\* smart as males. Like it’s “cute” that I play some video games. It’s strongly affected my personal bias towards my male viewers and that sucks because I know not all of them are like that, but when it happens a LOT more to women than it does to men...we kind of just assume first.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
The relentless focus on physicality and age is just one of the challenges female creators face. There is a ton of harassment, stalking, threats.
have been at the burnout stage several times - due to harassment.
I don’t know how to advise, other than to simply take breaks when necessary. Thanks for this post and I think that perhaps younger women, or those who don’t have a very large following (or those who are ignorant) may be in denial about how the female experience differs to the male experience. There is a lot of unlearning to do.
People commenting negatively on my appearance- makeup, clothing etc. When it has nothing to do with my content at all. I don't do fashion, beauty, lifestyle etc. It's irrelevant. I'm sure most creators experience this at some point though, not just females
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
there is an element of ""why would i take advice from a female who can't even get her makeup/hair/outfit right"" that does seem mainly reserved for female creators. And getting the opposite ""you're so pretty you deserve more subs"" isn't less offensive.
Just scroll through comments of male creators vs females - and count how many comments relate to appearance vs content. The proportions are wildly different - even when the genre is unrelated..
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
All you see in my videos is an angle from above of a piano keyboard, my hands playing the said keyboard, and my legs underneath. The amount of times I get comments about my legs is ridiculous... ""cover them up, I can't concentrate"" and the like. I've had marriage proposals because ""your hands are beautiful, imagine what else you can do with them"" etc etc. It's a good thing I don't show my face... can't imagine how much worse things would be ???? I don't get too much harassment specifically for being female though I do get the odd ""it would sound so much better if a guy played this music"" ?
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*","I scream in a metalcore band, to give you an idea of our audience size, we were on the entire last full US Vans Warped Tour on the main metal stage. I don’t read the comments on our music videos on YouTube. Stopped years ago. Only see what my loved ones specifically show me. 
Got death and rape threats when my band announced our record label signing back in 2017.  Pretty much set the precedent that being a woman in the public eye, especially in an almost exclusively male genre, was not gonna be a good time for me. It’s gotten better in some ways, worse in others.
I only post personal content on my IG, and only do livestreams on there. Because then it’s just my fans and followers engaging. YouTube is pretty notoriously fucking heinous for comments about women, Facebook is bad too. I stopped using FB in July (because the science says it’s terrible for your mental health and I was starting an intensive school program) and haven looked back. 
Tbh, a good combo of medication and therapy helps too. Seriously. I have pretty severe PTSD from being abused in a cult for a year as a teen, and multiple sexual assaults, so verbal abuse and threats are doubly triggering for me.

I'm not sure I'll be able to express my thoughts here but I'll try. I found feminism (more like power feminism) in my childhood and promised myself I'd change the world by getting top marks in university and investing everything in a career and then hiring women one day. (lol)
Over the years my power feminism delusion was shattered as I got into my male-dominated field and suffered from harassment, touching, bullying, patronising, male workers being promoted and paid more despite doing less work than me, being left out of the boys club, despite me also being interested in stereotypically male interests so the only difference is physical. Men being considered geniuses just for existing. When talking about issues I've suffered I'm asked if I'm making things up or being overly sensitive.
My field (tech) has men regularly wondering aloud if women are biologically capable of tech, or if we should even help them into the field in the first place. 
It has also been slowly driving me mentally insane that the men who are the most misogynistic and incapable of interacting with, or seeing women as human beings are the most likely to be given leadership positions and lauded for their intellect. (my idea of intelligence obviously does not match the workplace's idea of intelligence)
So as we know, meritocracy does not exist. Anyone who isn't a healthy-bodied white, male will have to shoulder and bear so much more bullshit and stress just to get ahead in the workplace. And when it comes to subconscious bias, you can't fight an invisible enemy.
I've just been continuing along in rage at the state of the tech industry. Here are the choices that I have:
1. Work 10x harder than the men around me to get ahead, and in doing so rewarding my bosses with extra profits, and rewarding them for them creating an unfair culture in their workplace that I have to disproportionately shoulder.
2. Change to a non-male-dominated field and earn lower wages. I'm from a very poor background this means I would be closing myself off to options and freedom in my life. I don't want to go back because I can see in my extended family what a lifetime lack of money means, and i remember what it was like until I got my first 'real' job. It can be stressful and sometimes terrifying to not have a financial backup.
3. Instead of feeling disrespect toward the culture of the workplace, I become a little more delusional and accept it and support it fully. Blend in, care deeply about company profits, invest optimistically in my skills and spend less and less time reading books on the ""imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"" that exists everywhere in the world. Believe in meritocracy and that if I was good enough I'd get ahead. Basically unsee everything that i see right now.

How do you survive 30+ years in the working world, while knowing what you know, without going insane? I think the more you read about the state of the world, the less likely you're able to deal with the repeated, immature, small-minded, backwards politics of the workplace.","Have you considered calling them on their bullshit? I’m in the army so it’s virtually impossible for me to lose my job, so this might not be an option for you. But when men speak over me I interrupt them and tell them thats not okay. When they ask whether women should be there I point major errors they’ve made, or I point out the holes in their logic depending on the scenario. It’s got its own drawbacks, in that I’m going to war every time I run into an asshole, and the real trash can humans will never change, but some of the more Center people who just couldn’t see what they were doing over their privilege have changed.
I’m actually at a crossroads right now. I know that this will stagnate my career at times when I have a largely male, trash can chain of command because I’m not brown nosing and giggling the way they want (and they do expect the brown nosing from men as well) but I think I’m happy being where I am forever as long as my ethics are in tact.",41

If you don’t feel like reading the whole thing (hopefully you at least read the important 
parts of it for the specific context of why I ask this question), skip to the last paragraph.
This post is a little bit all over the place, but let me give some background. My parents are Eritrean immigrants who came to the US in the mid to late eighties during Eritrea’s war with Ethiopia, and I was born in the US. Their general belief is that the social and economic oppression of a large portion of the working/lower class African American population in the US is the result of the characteristics of black “culture” (if there is  even such a thing as a unified African American culture) which promotes behaviors that allow them to be subjected to unfair treatment from other racial groups like white people. I don’t really have much of a viewpoint on this because I don’t believe I have the proper life experience to make that kind of judgement. Nevertheless, there is some dissonance in the subject that I would like to get some clarification on:
Many of our parents and family members in the Habesha community (Ethiopian/Eritrean community) came to the US as refugees during the eighties and nineties (some even as early as the seventies). A large number of them are not particularly educated, with many of them having fled their country from villages/rural areas. It is not uncommon for many of our parents to have never completed elementary school. Even from the small minority of those who were able to receive a university degree in their home country, their degrees are generally largely unusable in the US for employment purposes, and so their job prospects are similar to other refugees.
When they come here, they generally work minimum wage jobs, work under the table for cash, and live in low income housing. My understanding from what they tell us is that they work a lot and save up money (along with being on welfare of course) until they can move out of the low income housing, and then they find a wife/husband and have children somewhere else. If they want keep taking advantage of the low cost living, they remain in low income housing, get married, and have kids, and once the kids are old enough that they can be “influenced by the hood mentality” (their words), the parents are somehow able to take their kids and leave the neighborhood.
Despite this, our parents still work low income jobs and receive welfare benefits, but their kids enjoy a typical, middle class life. I don’t know the details of everyone’s finances, so I am unaware of how exactly they manage, but in the grand scheme, our families generally don’t face many unbearable financial hardships due to living in America. In addition, there is pressure for our parents to send money back to Africa for their parents/siblings/extended family and friends, which many (especially men) do quite often. But socioeconomically, they remain at the same status throughout their lives as refugees. In my neighborhood alone, there have always been around 5 to 10 taxi cabs sitting around, all owned and driven by Eritreans/Ethiopians, and that typically ends up being their livelihood until they stop working. Some woman stay at home to raise their children, while others work menial jobs to support the household.
Any kind of generational wealth for us is obviously non existent, and so it is in our family’s interest for us to “become successful” in our careers. Although our parents’ socioeconomic status has not and probably will not change in the US, the American born youth of the community has become quite successful, with many US born children having already received their PhDs and earning high salaries.
To white people and other non-African minorities, we appear as black. We still receive plenty of microaggression on account of our race. My father has been pulled over by the police numerous times when driving alone for matching certain suspicious profiles. My mother and I have been followed around in stores countless times and have been watched carefully by several employees at the checkout line. Even when passing by someone’s house at night in my neighborhood, there are some people who, instead of entering their house after exiting their car, stand by their front door and watch us until we pass by before opening their front door and entering their house. A lot of this behavior does come from other uneducated foreigners, but definitely not all of it. My mother has a English sounding last name, and so on paper, she is often mistaken for a white woman. When making doctors appointments, people’s tones immediately change once they hear that she has an accent. She recently wanted to buy a used car from someone, and when the lady who was selling it spoke to her (she was white), she became very nervous and kept asking whether or not the woman who had initially messaged her was really her (this woman had been very enthusiastic about selling my mother the car before this). The woman then kept asking my mother about where exactly she lived, how many kids she had, where she worked, and a bunch of other irrelevant questions, and she kept slowly trying to back out of the transaction. My mother was fully aware of what was happening, and she assured her that she didn’t have to sell if she didn’t want to, told her to have a nice day, and decided not to talk with her any further. Growing up, I took violin lessons, and in the first couple of lessons, my mother would come with me. The (white) teacher flat out told me to tell my mother she expected a regular check payment every month and that she “doesn’t like checks that bounce” (her exact words).
These are just a few of many experiences involving race that I have had growing up, but because my parents always had such a seemingly nonchalant attitude about it, I never learned to be offended by any of it. In fact,  my mother and I found it pretty hilarious most of the time.
TL;DR: I know it is unfair to make sweeping comparisons, but I have always been genuinely confused as to how related the “black American” experience is today for African Americans and for African refugees. Despite the humble beginnings of African refugees in America, it is my understanding that their first generation children in America end up rising above the status they grew up with. I don’t know too much about the Somali community, but from those I have known, their experiences seem to be similar. I am certain that there are a lot of holes in my knowledge, and so that’s why I wanted to ask reddit to clear up whatever ignorance and help me learn more. First of all, do children of African immigrants (specifically refugees) do better on average than African Americans economically, and if so, are there any concrete correlations that can be associated with this? Do they face similar systemic disadvantages? Is it easier for someone like me or my parents to not be offended by racist behavior/attitudes towards us? Am I facing a lot of confirmation bias by growing up in the environment that I did? Is any comparison between the two groups valid at all? Does anyone have any better information on this?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Mind-blowing as the theories are, there's always that uneasy feeling of doubt: What if the theories are all guessworks? How are their validity assessed? How are they used and how are they relevant to the real world? 
When he was Chairman of the Social Science Research Council in Britain, Andrew Schonfield wrote:
>""In the social sciences it is rarely possible to pose questions and provide answers in the manner of some of the natural sciences, and it is a refusal to recognize this that has often led us up the wrong path. It is the nature of most of our work that it tends to produce useful ideas and an increasingly firm factual base, rather than clear-cut answers to major policy questions. We must try to tease out the relationships which have a crucial effect on policy and, in doing so, provide not so much widely applicable generalizations as a sound, informed basis for decision-making and, at the same time, cut down the area of reliance on guesswork and prejudice."" (Schonfield, 1971).
I wholeheartedly agree with this quote, but can't seem to find the ""increasingly firm factual base"" for the theories that I'm interested in. For example, do we have any ways to verify Foucault's claims of how power works, or Judith Butler's claims of the existence of many genders, apart from just following the reasoning in their books? What are their contributions to practice-oriented research, apart from providing a possible interpretation of the social phenomena in question? Does policy-making ultimately rely on factual findings, rather than the theories?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

But is there anyway to objectively measure this?
There are measurements of inequality in a society like economic inequality and gender inequality. [The GINI coefficient works by measurement how often high incomes and low incomes occur at certain frequencies of the population.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) The [Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii) measures the inequality of women in a society by measures of reproductive health, political and occupational empowerment, and economic status.

But how would you measure how common racial prejudice is in a given country or society. [BuisinessTech used a poll](https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/116644/the-most-racist-countries-in-the-world/) by seeing how each country responds to having people of another race as neighbors. This seems flawed though because there is more to racism than just living next to each other and countries have vastly different demographics and definition of race; not to mention potential response bias at play. [You could just observe how many ethnic conflicts/wars and race riots a particular country has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_riots) and presume that it must be a very racist or non-racist country based on that. But again, there could be more reasons for lack of riots than just good race relations like homogeneity or an authoritarian dictatorship. I think the most comprehensive tool available might be the Implicit Association Test done in [America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/) and [Europe.](https://mindhacks.com/2017/05/03/this-map-shows-what-white-europeans-associate-with-race-and-it-makes-for-uncomfortable-reading/) Unfortunately the studies seem to be focused on Anti-Black racism rather than racism in general.

I think the biggest problem with an index for racism is the different ethnic demographics different countries have. There are plenty of countries that are over 98% one ethnic group and many of the people who live there will never encounter a person of another ethnicity in their entire life. In a homogeneous country like that, the general population might not understand race or ethnic relations the way far more diverse countries do so polling them about race would lead to strange results.

Is there a global or international index that measures racial discrimination in a given jurisdiction or nation-state? If there isn't what is the best way to potentially measure it?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Americans actually have little clue about politics and bureaucracy, but tend to have strong opinion about it and think their opinion matter/need to be heard, because the media industry has made politics as entertainment with all the drama, spectacle, even actors and clowns. The media industry also values sensationalism and put people who make the headline into the spotlight, regardless of what they actually say.

Can systematic racism occur in countries or areas where white people are considered a minority, in executive roles as well as in the general population?
Honestly curious about this, since I was taught in my sociology class in college that **prejudice** is harboring an unfavorable generalization about a particular race/ethnic group, **racism** is acting on that prejudice to the detriment of someone from that race or ethnic group (sometimes with power, sometimes without, depending on who you are talking to), and **institutional racism** (structural racism) is racism built into laws of infrastructure using power from those who are prejudiced. 
This leads me to the question: Sociologically, can racism and institutional racism be perpetrated against a white person in either a sub-section of the United States, or in a foreign country?

A man working on himself is seen to be doing it for selfish reasons. You see him as believing himself entitled to her ""gift"".  You see his self improvement as being for selfish and entitled reasons.",46

Could someone authoritatively speak to these statistics?,"Drawn from this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gvc7k9/black_lives_matter/
>Source from the Department of Justice, look at table 12. The number of White violent offenders in 2018 was 2,669,900, White people were 62.3% of the population. The number of Black violent offenders was 1,155,670, Black people were 12% of the population. If Black people are that much overrepresented as violent offenders based on data from the survey of victims of crimes (data from the FBI also shows vast overrepresentation), then how is it racist for the police to be more likely to kill (justifiably or not) Black suspects?
Another post: 
>Police killings in the USA for 2018:
>White: 451 killed / 5.3M arrests = .008%
>Black: 229 killed / 2.1M arrests = .011%
>Hispanic: 165 killed / 1.2M arrests = .014%
>Black people are about 10 percent more likely to be killed during an arrest than the average. Perhaps that needs improvement, but it hardly constitutes a crisis in and of itself. The bigger problem is that black people are twice as likely to get arrested.
A third:
>Blacks are 2.5 times more likely to die from police because they disproportionately commit more violent crimes. FBI crime statistics from 2017 show that blacks committed 37.5% of violent crimes. Blacks make up 13.4% of the population, yet they are 2.79 times more likely to commit a violent crime. Hispanic/Latino individuals make up 18.3% of the population and commit 23.5% of violent crimes, so they are 1.28 times more likely to commit a violent crime.
**All the statistics in these comments appear to be accurate, but I believe I am missing something.** I have no doubt that the conditions of poverty and the legacies of systemic racism contribute to the contemporary behavior of some boys and men within the black community (media stereotypes, broken homes, poor education/nutrition, alienated families, low-income housing, etc.). **Nor do I believe that there is any genetic basis for any of these circumstances.** I'm sure it's all socialization.

I think fat shaming seems to be the most prevalent form of this, but I see it manifest in other ways as well. 
I've been told that this isn't a feminist issue and told by some others to take a sort of apathetical approach to it, but that doesn't feel right to do, I guess?? 
Minus the discussions about what causes obesity and what we as a society can do to prevent and treat it, why does this particular topic always devolve into a hostile, bullying free-for-all? People that are overweight or obese are still deserving of some basic level of respect and dignity as human beings, but it's both baffling and disheartening to see so many people dismiss that aspect of the issue.
A few years ago, I had a major injury which prevented me from being as active as I normally am and as a result, I got fairly chubby. It was awful to experience first-hand that sort of bias that so many people have towards bigger bodies. As I recovered, I became more active again and eventually lost the weight, but I quickly noticed the way people were treating me better! My best friend also happens to be obese, and I know she's dealt with discrimination and harassment because of her size. I'm very close to her, so the thought of others treating her like that infuriates me.
I feel like some people just think that an overweight or obese person existing is 'GlOrIfYiNg ObEsItY' and take the opportunity to launch into a stream of reasons as to why that person is unhealthy and why they don't have to respect them because of their size.
I know that the origin of fatphobia comes from a deeply racist and misogynistic history. So why do so many feminists ignore, or contribute to the bullying when there is a bigger push for the movement to be intersectional?","Because being a feminist doesn't stop you being prejudice or bias in other ways - same way we have racism in the LGBTQ+ community, ableism in anti-racism communities, etc.

Hi! This is my first post and sorry if similar topics have been answered before - I opted for a new post so I can capture the details. I'm really just wondering on what people think about this since it has really stuck with me and I've been reflecting a lot as a result:
**Context**  
Before the pandemic, I was seeing a girl I met at University (a few months and it didn't work out but it ended amicably). One of the days we were hanging out at my place with three of my housemates (female) and they frequently commented on things like the male character in a film (The Quiet Place - I recommend it, btw!) being useless and stupid because he's a man, and me not understanding why he's useless because I'm also man, etc. Since this is a Reddit post, I don't want to paint them in a bad light: I could tell they didn't mean anything negative by it and it seemed like they were kind of having a good time and bouncing off each other. Similar things happened frequently with this girl during the time we were seeing each other, but to the point.
Later that night, she asked what was bothering me since she could tell something was on my mind (I was taking longer than usual to fall asleep). I explained that I felt a bit weird and didn't really like when she/my housemates would often make negative remarks about me or my other housemate (the other guy in the house) and attribute when we messed up (less jokey examples) to being male. We had a messy argument about it which we resolved over the course of a few hours. The next morning I felt uncomfortable about it so we talked some more and were both put at ease.
**My Questions**  
What I'm asking about are the things she said that really stuck with me:
I said (approx) that I can only sympathize with the effects of sexism against women (she said that I didn't understand because I'm a man) but that I'm only responsible for myself / not how other men act and have acted in the past.  
She said (approx) that I need to take responsibility and that I don't get to complain about those kinds of comments since the oppression of women now (and historically) is so much worse.
I said something like how I would completely accept something like that if it were because of something I was responsible for and could appreciate the motivation but that it didn't make sense to me as to why they should be directed at me if I try my best to be better (and would call myself a feminist / act against sexism). She said that it might not be rational but that I should just trust that she knows that it's the case and that I was being a 'not-all-men bitch'.
Obviously I am writing this and it's reliant on my memory but I've done my best to give a fair account of what actually happened rather than being butt-hurt because she called me a bitch, lol.
Apologies that this is a long ping-pong of a post but I figured that asking here might be a good idea since maybe this has flagged up something in myself (like an implicit bias or way of thinking) that I need to identify and work on. **My questions are essentially just whether this way of thinking is something I should try to avoid (even if it doesn't make sense to me) or that my behavior is the kind of thing that contributes to sexism and works against feminist progress.**
Thanks!","I think you’re doing your due diligence just fine by acknowledging historical oppression and understanding the role it plays in this situation
However, I don’t think you’re wrong for feeling uncomfortable about these jokes. They’re crass and it’s understandable that they would bother you. As you said, you aren’t personally responsible for the way things are.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/g5852b/what_do_you_think_about_this_video_opinion_on/,AskFeminists,bias|prejudice,g5852b,2020-04-20,13,37,Dior5x5,What do you think about this video opinion on Title IX handling sexual assault investigations,"Stotland an education consultant gives a nuanced opinion on the topic of sexual assault in terms of how it is adjudicated on campuses. Stotland believes the topic is more complex than the responses given by universities and colleges today. It gives anecdotal evidence from both men and women and their experiences with Title IX told by Stotland. In one example an accused male student was expelled when both him and the accuser agreed that they consented the only split was that the accuser mentioned that they had faked the orgasm to get out of the room more gracefully. The accused in this situation was found responsible and suspended for 2 years. Stotland admits this is an extreme case but states that she has realized in this issue than “Yes” does not always mean “Yes” and that consent is not always simple or clear cut and that we should teach young people how to navigate confusing moments rather than insist things are all black and white. 
 Stotland makes a possible controversial point where she states that many a time, society wants to place a liar and a truth teller in the topic of a campus sexual assault report, however this is not always correct. She believes that at times both sides are truthfully reporting their bias externally influenced often drunken memories of a night. Which points to the an overall statement that there is not always an absolute truth or absolute wrong in these complex topics. Which calls for a better response to deal with this issue on campus.
Another example Stotland uses is an example where one of her students was accused of assault where both sides admitted to consent at first. However the accuser began to cry during the sex. The accuser says that the accused did not stop immediately when this happened but the accused student stated that he stopped immediately once he noticed the accuser was crying. Stotland asserts that neither student is lying, further she states that we shouldn’t fram every disagreement as a disagreement between a truth teller and a liar.
Stotland also gives a third example between two woman who during freshman year got drunk and had a sexual encounter with a male student. Both of those women felt that they were sexually assaulted by the male student however only one of those students reported the incident to the university. During the course of the investigation Stotland says that the one who had reported it began to feel as though the other woman was also at fault. The woman who had not reported the sexual assault became the accused and was also found responsible and suspended for 3 1/2 years for an incident which she feels she was raped. Stotland believes that when the narrative is black and white that victims can become “perpetrators”.
Stotland then goes on to mention that in these cases and in the majority of her other cases there is one element they all have in common. Alcohol. Stotland talks about how we as a society don’t want to talk about the roles of alcohol abuse because we rightly don’t want to blame victims. However Stotland differs in thinking after that point, she thinks that addressing alcohol abuse on campuses would prevent students from becoming “perpetrators”. Scotland culminates her opinions by stating that if the mission is to end sexual assault we must lean into the “gray zone” not try to erase it. 
She concludes by saying this 
-let’s stop equating a good time in college with getting wasted all the time
-let’s create specific names for specific actions
-let’s teach the nuances o consent and good communication 
-And most importantly let’s treat sexual assault on campus like a Public Health issue. That means preventing not just punishing.

Regardless if they have it or not, it's still undeniably evident that medicine doesn't prioritize women's health as they should. The only time this condition is given an afterthought is when a woman is trying to conceive.
More women with PCOS that identify as feminists need to spread more advocacy and awareness on this condition because most doctors in and out of the US isn't. The rampant sexism and gender bias in the system is why PCOS is under-researched and under-funded. I'm in my early 20s and most of my physicians have been women and they do NOT care about us. I feel like since this only affects a small percentage of women of reproductive age, they don't consider it a priority. Had it affected 90% of the female of population, maybe.","Hey! I’m a 30 something with PCOS. I’ve definitely felt very dismissed by doctors whenever it comes up. Part of the problem for me is that I’m also tokophobic and I have zero interest in ever having biological children, so as soon as doctors hear that - they basically say it’s not a problem then. As in - my health only matters if it’s to become pregnant. It’s super frustrating. There are tons of other ways PCOS can negatively impact someone’s health, outside of infertility (as you said in OP). The fact that I don’t want to gestate a fetus is not a reason to not treat my PCOS. So I hear you. 
And as a tangentially related topic, I wish there was also more research into alternative ways to gestate a fetus. I wish women did not have to use our bodies to biologically reproduce and I wish there was more funding toward that goal. Pregnancy is risky, time consuming, painful and contributes to gender inequality. I’m not saying pregnancy should be prohibited once we have this hypothetical technology (yikes that’s a scary thought too) - or that it’s not something to be proud of and enjoy if you like it - I just wish there was more funding toward alternatives. Hell, I would even accept just less shame around even mentioning this. When I mention it, the usual response is that it’s a blasphemous science fiction idea. People usually call it creepy. I find that reaction outrageous. Why is it so extreme to suggest reproducing without using and harming AFAB bodies? 
Anyway, good luck with your treatment. It’s definitely frustrating. I hear you.",18

She even feels that a man paying for a woman is rape, even if it's someone doing sex work out of choice. She feels this way because in the past she has had male colleagues she has worked with make sexual jokes about her and other male colleagues laugh and thus all men see women as sex objects, and feels that to suggest that men want to watch porn or pay for sex other than because they see women as sex objects is invalidating her experience.  
Personally I'm a gay guy and have a quite different outlook on sex as I don't have the overlay of gender in my relationship with sex. For that reason I don't think there is inherently an issue with paying for sex or watching because maybe you just like sex. I fully acknowledge the context of the objectification of women by straight men is there, and I acknowledge both the straight porn and sex work industries are largely catering towards men, but I don't think the only reason a man would watch porn or pay for sex is because he sees that woman as an object. I kinda feel like my sisters views are bias towards the fact she doesn't like casual sex or porn so assumes every woman feels the same and think she needs to acknowledge the way people look at female sexuality.

Am I being ignorant and completely missing something, or do you agree with me?","As a sex worker, it is true that the existence of the industry and the conditions within the industry are heavily influenced by patriarchy and other oppressive influences. I don’t think it is true to say that only men who view women as objects would see sex workers. In my own experience, I know this is anecdotal, but sometimes they are very respectful and see it as a service being provided by a professional. I also think it’s really problematic to say that because of the social influence of misogyny that all sex workers can’t really consent. It denies people’s autonomy to make the best choice for themselves in the position they’re in and it also erases the difference between a sex worker saying yes and a sex worker saying no. The degree to which sex workers can safely express consent and it be respected is extremely important to our safety. Saying that all SW is inherently rape undermines the efforts of sex workers activists to make sure our autonomy is respected. No choices exist in a vacuum, but the extent to which a person can make choices is still important. All work done under capitalism is coercive by nature and all sexual interaction between a woman (or person presenting as a woman) and a man is influenced by gender power dynamics. But what that means in practice is different situationally and generalizing about all sex work the way people like this do is a shallow view of the situation imo",18

Also, the Confederate Constitution *specifically* singles out African Negroes as slaves, not Irish people. Also, neither country was ravaged as heavily as African countries by European people.
  In any case, after literal *lifetimes* of slavery, Black folks were hit very harshly with Jim Crow Laws which didn't end until the 1950s. [The origins of gangs with African Americans actually started because they had to defend themselves from racists while also trying to make a dollar.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/gangcolor/madness.htm). 
""A final factor encouraging gang formation was the Chicago race riot of 1919, in which gangs of white youth terrorized the black community, and in response black youth formed groups for self-protection.[60]""

""Racial anti-black violence on the part of white youths directly contributed to black youths forming self-protection societies that transformed into black gangs by the late 1960s.[61]""

- Also, according to Yale's *Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police*, while the police shoot and murder Black and White folks at roughly the same rate controlled for different factors, they also found that Black and Hispanic folks are 50% more likely to be subject to some force when being arrested. The study suggests that when controlled for contextual and behavioral factors, the number is reduced but still doesn't explain racial disparities.

- Black people are more likely to have their cars searched (and less likely to be explained a reason why). A Rhode Island study also showed they were likely to be stopped *and* somehow less likely to receive a citation. To me, this suggests that they were effectively stopped for no reason. A study in New York City showed that blacks were more likely than whites or nonblack minorities to be in jail while they await trial, even after controlling for the seriousness of charges and prior record. Black people are also 13% more likely to receive a plea deal that included longer jail time, again controlling for factors such as prior record. Researchers found that North Carolina prosecutors were excluding black people from juries in capital cases at twice the rate of other jurors, even when controlling for legitimate justifications for striking jurors, such as employment status or reservations about the death penalty. Black convicts have their probation revoked more often than whites and other minorities, according to a study of probation outcomes in Iowa, New York, Oregon, and Texas. These racial disparities held even when the study controlled for other characteristics of the probationers, such as their age, crime severity, and criminal history.

 >Despite only accounting for 13% of the population, blacks commit 56% of crime.
The claim that black people “commit X% of crime in America while only accounting for 12% of the US population” fails to take into account the effect of poverty on criminal behavior. Crime rates follow poverty trends *much* closer than they do race.
The Kaiser Family Foundation has provided [this chart](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, 2008-2017. There are about 14.5 million white people and 7.8 million black people living in poverty in the US. If crime rate is driven by poverty rate, we can expect that black perpetrators will amount to about **53.8%** of the number of white perpetrators, accounting for about **35%** of all criminals who are either black or white.
[Here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43) is the FBI’s Crime in the US 2018 report by its Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which collects arrest data from over 12,000 agencies across the country. It is important to remember these figures represent arrests, not individuals (since one individual can be arrested multiple times) nor convictions. The is a huge obstacle when it comes to assessing who *commits* more crime, but it remains one of the only sources for crime data available. So let’s review:
Table 43A  
White arrests: 5,319,654  
Black arrests: 2,115,381  
Total B+W: 7,435,035
Based on these numbers alone, black arrests amount to way under half (39.8%) of white arrests, or 28% of the total B+W arrests.
However, the figure of white Americans in poverty from the KFF website excluded white hispanics, while the white arrests may or may not be Hispanic, so I will correct for that and attempt to find the number of non-Hispanic white arrests. The reporting of Hispanic arrests is incomplete because not all agencies report Hispanic ethnicity. 7,710,900 arrests are included under race, while only 6,343,684 arrests are either ‘Hispanic or Latino’ (1,191,334) or ‘Not Hispanic or Latino’ (5,152,350). If this proportion (18.8% Hispanic) hold true, then out of 7,710,900 arrests we can expect that around 1,449,649 were Hispanic (sig. figs. be damned)
Of these Hispanic arrests, how many were white? That’s tough to know. According to Page 6 in the [Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf) by the US Census Bureau, approximately 53% of Hispanic individuals are White Only. But let’s ignore that and assume for a moment that *all* 1,449,649 Hispanic arrests were white, and that not a single Hispanic individual was black or American Indian. That brings the number of non-Hispanic white arrests down to:
Non-Hispanic White arrests: 3,870,005  
Black arrests: 2,115,381  
Total: 5,985,386
Here, Black arrests are equal **54.6%** of the Non-Hispanic White arrests, **35.3%** of total arrests. Even with this *very generous* estimation of how many hispanics arrests were also white, we see that the arrest rate of black people as compared to white people is proportionate to their poverty rate.
Keep in mind the FBI is reporting arrests, not convictions. And police are already biased. So even with biased police officers, and even without using convictions as a standard for guilt, this is what we get. For comparison, here's a source that uses the reported race of the offender, rather than arrests:
Bureau of Justice Statistics: [Criminal Victimization, 2017](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv17.pdf)  
Page 11, Table 10  
*Nonfatal violent incidents, by total population, victim, and offender demographic characteristics, 2017*  
Offender:  
White: 49.2%  
Black: 24.5%  
Black offenders are **49.8%** of white offenders, **33.2%** of total offenders
This is further supported by previous BJS studies, such as:  
[Race and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders, 2012-2015](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rhovo1215.pdf)

Offender:  
White: 43.8%  
Black: 22.7%  
Black offenders are **51.8%** of white offenders, **34.1%** of total offenders

“Attraction ultimately comes from prejudice: we find different and unfamiliar things uncomfortable over things we're use to”
I was like Attraction definitely does not comes from prejudice. But of course, I didn't tell him that because I'm not a biologist. But I feel that it's wrong.
Am I wrong for feeling that way? Is he wrong. Or is his statement true? If he Is correct, please explain to me why and why my reaction to his statement is incorrect.","Title question: No.
They are wrong. Evolutionary biologists (regardless of this weird outlier) explain that attractiveness comes from traits that at least appear to confer evolutionary advantage to offspring.
For example, large eyes (both distinctive & appear to be better at sight) are pretty universally attractive. A symmetrical face/body structure is universally seen as attractive (this is, evolutionary speaking, an indication of a lack of birth defect/poor health).
Big breasts are more popular than small because they indicate a woman who has reached full maturity & isn't too young to safely have a child. Breasts that don't sag are more popular because they indicate a woman who is young enough to be in prime child-bearing age.
Men who show emotions, softness, and tenderness are more attractive because those traits are (evolutionary) interpreted (often incorrectly) as indicating someone more likely to stay loyal to spouse & children, thus able to confer greater advantage to offspring.
He's wrong. Prejudice CAN influence attraction, but that isn't a biological response. It's learned prejudice. So it doesn't ultimately come from prejudice.
Variations in what people find attractive (short vs tall, big nose vs small) are explained again by evolution. Among relatively meaningless (evolutionary speaking) traits, having a variety of opinion among individuals is evolutionary beneficial. Genetic variety = greater chance for a species to survive crises points (like a major disease). So species (including our own) do have various biological mechanisms that encourage a diversity of what characteristics individuals find attractive.
And thus, a friend and I can have VERY different opinions on what physical types of women are beautiful and which are not - very much independent of what we're familiar with.",15

How come lots of conspiracy theories (that have been debunked time and time again) are mostly aimed to argue against science instead of against other things?,"So to my knowledge of psychology, people are capable of doing all of sorts of things that will make sense in their heads. Confirmation bias, proportionality bias and the factors of upbringing and other cultural factors have an effect on how a person will think and reason (Pygmalion effect, social learning theory and even the self-fulfilling prophecy).
This makes a lot of sense because people will look for information that will confirm or back up their claims, no matter how obscure or minuscule the data might be; and one's upbringing or cognitive development and reasoning (personality, personal perspective and so on) because of their upbringing or experience will surely have an effect on how a person will perceive certain phenomena (for example, if you were raised to believe that the Earth was created exactly based on what a holy text says, you are more likely to accept and believe the information that is presented on said text especially as it is described as holy and should not be contested).
I also think that maybe the anti-authority believes that are presented in multiple forms of media of today also have an influence on the development of conspiracy theories like in novels, we have 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and other dystopian/apocolyptic worlds with a clear anti-authority message behind it; or the reveals of shady historical events that have actually happened such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Watergate scandal, the Tuskegee syphilis study, the Jonestown incident and so on.
I also think that how certain subjects are taught have an influence on how people react to authority figures such as how the history of your home country was developed and how it behaved throughout history compared to other countries will probably have an influence on the person's point of view about their cultural beliefs compared to the cultural beliefs of others (the ingroup and outgroup mentality).
But there is this big question mark that I still do not understand - why are there so conspiracy theories are clearly developed to target science in general or certain scientific beliefs or consensuses? - the moon landing of 1969, the conspiracy theories against COVID-19, the paranoia against 5G technology, the contempt against conventional medicine and the support for alternative/controversial medicine like herbal medicine, healing crystals and homoeopathy, the fear against vaccines and the supposed associated with autism, the flat Earth theory and so on.
I know that science is not always correct and flawless and that is why there is a concept of falsifiability in order to challenge and reexamine scientific data. And I also know of the concept of the backfire effect also exists meaning that no matter how hard you try to challenge another person's counter-arguments with verifiable data to back up yours, the less likely you are to actually change their argument and will try to defend their position even more.
But most of these conspiracy theories try to challenge certain scientific consensuses that have been backed up by reliable and valid examinations time and time again where it has become close to impossible to argue against them with a sound argument.
It gives the impression that there is a certain group of people in this world (even if it is a very tiny but vocal one) that has a hateful agenda against conventional science in general which is unbelievably curious.","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

I conduct research in the field of criminal justice focusing on the intersection of gender and crime. My primary interests are cyberstalking/harassment and intimate partner violence, but I have a secondary interest in sexual assault issues.
I have a few side questions here and I want to ""make my case,"" as it were. I consider myself an ally to feminist causes and try to keep feminist perspectives in mind when researching for and writing papers, so I hope that this is taken in good faith, as I write it as such.
**My primary focus:**
Today, I was reading a thread on one of my social media pages where a woman I am friends with posted that if a woman is drunk, she cannot consent to sex, *period*. As one might expect, women in the comments agreed and one man objected. This appears to be the common response; that women mostly agree and men mostly disagree.
In my opinion, it's more complicated an issue than we sometimes give it credit. On the one hand, it's probably wise not to drink and have sex with anyone who isn't our already-committed partner. If someone is heavily intoxicated and we are not, we should never sleep with them or touch them in a sexual manner.
**On the other hand, how do we determine fault if both parties were drunk, and where do we set the bar? That is to say, is** ***any*** **alcohol at all too much to consent, or is there a certain threshold? How do we determine whether either party was too drunk to consent if there is a threshold without their blood alcohol levels? If a woman begins by accusing a man of sexual assault because she was drunk, but he was likewise drunk and decides to accuse her back, how do we determine who was telling the truth? (I'm not sure temporal order is a sound choice considering it would set a bad precedent to assume the person who accuses first is the most honest, as a victim may have many legitimate reasons for hesitating to report an assault or crime.)**
I'm not talking about obvious cases where we have a woman so drunk she's unconscious and a man who hasn't had a drink is engaging in sexual acts with her while she's passed out, I mean ambiguous circumstances. If we are going to use broad, sweeping language to determine whether women can consent when intoxicated, we have to determine whether it applies to every scenario or only a few. If it's only a few or certain situations that the argument applies to, the argument that *drunk at all* means *cannot consent* becomes untenable. I don't think I am taking the position out of context when the argument is proposed as follows (quoting one of the people in the thread from my social media):  
>Even if someone was drinking they're under the influence. You can not legally get tattooed if you've been drinking because you can not properly consent. Sex is the same way. You cannot consciously consent to it.
The argument I usually see tends to begin with saying ""if she is drunk she can't consent,"" and then moves to ""blackout drunk"" when further justification is required. However, not all drinking or being drunk is ""blackout drunk."" Shifting terms in post-justification seems to me to be a reckless way to treat a serious and already-complex issue.
I think this is a real question we have to answer, not one we can hand-wave away. Beyond women's victimization, which is important, the answer of whether men can consent when drunk if women can't determines whether men who are sexually assaulted by women or other men are legitimized as victims. There is also the issue of determining guilt in cases where all we have to go on are peoples' word, which is not as easy as simply taking one side at face value and concluding the other party guilty (though, this is often what we do).
Sex isn't something done to women by men or vice versa, it's a mutual act (men ""fuck"" and women ""get fucked"" is language of patriarchal conditioning, I'd argue). So, if both parties are drunk at the same time, what happens, then? It seems misogynistic to argue that men, when intoxicated, are possessed of far more self-control or cognitive function than women. Is mutual accusation that courts must sort out the safest route? Consent forms seem a little excessive in a hookup culture, but I have seen getting written consent proposed seriously and mockingly (if we take it seriously, the problem with that would be proving the form wasn't signed under duress or that the person was competent enough to sign at the time).
In any case, sober sex is definitely the safest course of action.
**Tangential focus:**
Regarding the phrase ""believe women,"" as someone who has been a victim of cyber harassment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and false allegations at the hands of a former partner who was doing to me what she said I was doing to her, I think that we as a society need to reevaluate our interpretation of “believing victims” (regardless of gender). Specifically, the meaning of the phrase “believe.” My interpretation of believing victims is that we (the public, the justice system) should approach victims and perpetrators without preconceptions or prejudice. That is to say, putting aside preconceived notions and taking in and interpreting the facts of the case without judgment, in particular, while these facts are still coming out.
I have discussed this with colleagues at work and they've come to a similar consensus once we parse the language. Everyone certainly acknowledges that false accusations of sexual assault are far rarer than sexual assaults (which themselves are relatively rare as a subset of violent crime, generally, since crime and criminality themselves are relatively rare as compared to non-criminal conduct). What I am more concerned with here is how we determine guilt relative to mutual intoxication, or if we are developing a double standard in which men can consent when drunk and women cannot, thus rendering men rapists in cases where they could never be seen as legitimate victims themselves if the situation were reversed.
When I see someone accused of wrongdoing, I suspend judgment and wait for the facts. I don't assume the accuser or accused are telling the truth or lying, and I would hope that this should be the approach of law enforcement, as well. Meaning, they should listen to an accuser or victim without assuming things about her or him; for instance, they would listen without asking a woman why she was wearing a short skirt or why she was out drinking at 3 AM, or they would listen without asking a man why he didn't stop her if he didn't want it, and so forth.
That is, fundamentally, however, not “believing” victims in the sense of taking all their words as fact at face value. Yet, this appears frequently to be the way that this idea is interpreted. If I suspend judgment and observe facts without judgment as they come in, as I would hope police would when questioning an accuser and her or his accused, I feel pressured to side with the victim by default. But, I think that this does not capture the true spirit of ""believing victims"" that ought to be intended.
It seems to me that, while the justice system has a tendency to fail to handle many people who engage in sexual assault or domestic violence, the popular court of public opinion shoots firsts and asks questions later, and uses the above concept regarding belief wrongly. We too often fall on one extreme or the other in terms of 100% believing the victim or 100% victim-blaming, which I think happens just as often (men online immediately assuming the woman is lying, that is). Of course, the facts themselves need to be scrutinized fairly in the first place for this conversation to move forward in any meaningful way.
I hope this isn't too rambling. I am looking for a clearer feminist perspective on the varying variables of this topic, and have previously received some decent answers to questions here. I've not found reasonable satisfaction just from the people I know, and I don't think the #MeToo movement, which is still in its infancy, has reached the stage of addressing these nuances and issues yet, as it still fights for women's legitimization as victims at all (I don't fault it for that). Thank you!","Feminist perspectives, like criminal justice perspective, are in their infancy on the topic of drunk sex. College sex educators are just beginning to deviate from the binary of ""drunk = no consent.""
Psychologists and sexologists are working on questions like ""what does drunk consensual sex look like?"" "" How do we advise sexually active adults on incorporating alcohol in their sex lives?"" 
They're great questions. As for criminal justice, what you've said is correct. In most cases it's pretty clear if someone is committing sexual assault regardless of either person's intoxication levels: i.e: forcing oneself on a unconscious out drunk person is rape no matter how intoxicated either is. 
I think In more ambiguous ncases, more information besides alcohol level is going to determine if it is sexual assault, and who is the assaulter. Things like: Was someone violent? Did one person plan beforehand to get the other drunk and have sex with them? Was anyone coerced into sex?
In cases with similar levels of intoxication, all the other things that tend to indicate sexual assault, and help define consent are still hugely relevant. They might even be more significant than intoxication.

By Gender
The effect on the level of participation in the workforce by women is important because income levels tie closely with educational attainment. To illustrate, the data below indicates that female students have surpassed male students in academic attainment.
In 2018, college enrollment rates for recent high school graduates between age 16 and 24 were:
66.9% for male students
71.3% for female students
In 2019, women received over 57% of bachelor’s degrees awarded in the US
63% of women pursuing a bachelor’s degree at a four-year public or private non-profit college completed their degree within 6 years, compared to 57% of men
As of 2019, women hold over two-thirds of total student loan debt, approximately $929 billion
Approximately 35% of college-educated US adults (over age 25) typically generate 57% of earnings in the US economy
When it comes to post-graduate studies, women are also leading the way in enrollment numbers.
By the end of 2020, it is projected 1.8 million women will enroll in post-graduate programs, compared to 1.2 million men.
Contrast this to 1980, when 874,000 men enrolled in post-graduate programs. The same year, only 748,000 female students enrolled in post-graduate programs.
*****
So I'd like to ask about your opinion. 
Do you think this gap is natural or an indication of problems (discrimination or prejudice, bad treatment of boys at school, school program not taking into account some nuances of boys development). 
Is this situation somewhat different from STEM education gap, where women are minority? Should similar efforts be applied to improve general success of men in non-STEM? 
Should we seek for the root cause and try to fix it so the next generation of students will be have a more equal distribution? 
What consequences of this gap do you see, if problem is not addressed? Can it also affect women negatively? E.g by raising more men that blame society and women for their misfortunes - and thus becoming antifem? 
Some people attribute the problem to feminist movement, or at least think that feminists are silencing that topic. I saw bizarre articles like this one, yet it is about GB:
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/11/16/boys-left-fail-school-attempts-help-earn-wrath-feminists-says/
It is not clear what exactly british feminists did (or did they anythin at all) to shut down the program to help boys. But if that's a lie, it should be debunked.","It's an indication that there are more career paths that don't involve a higher education (trades for example) traditionally geared towards men than women, and that women are not going into those traditionally male-dominated career paths. Trades make up roughly a third of all U.S. employment (probably similar in the U.K.), and women's participation in almost all major trades are in the single digits. 
STEM is a different issue imo.",13

\- Somebody who is skeptical of feminism expresses that they don't really see the value of it (or even, expresses open hostility to it) in the modern world. (or, just, a feminist responds to this kind of question). 
\- A feminist argues in favor of feminism based on *past achievements of feminism in getting basic human rights of women recognized,* as well as *getting women basic equality under the law, and convincing people not to follow tightly restrictive gender roles,* as well as, in the present day, *putting an end to serious injustices in third-world countries where feminism has made much less progress* and *fighting distinct forms of sexist injustice such as distinct forms of sexual violence, discrimination, and  bias.* 
\- The person who is skeptical of feminism is not even vaguely opposed to any of the above activism areas of feminism (only a blatant revanchist would be), but they don't understand how this is to be connected to more ideological or controversial projects in feminism, or don't see how this is connected to efforts to make fairly sweeping changes not just to how society treats women and men, but to how society views gender in general.

However, I struggle to find a convincing description of a mechanism of discrimination hidden inside. In most cases, a proponent would post a correlation between race, parents' income and test results and proclaim themselves victorious. Those who dig deeper might describe the racist history of education and testing, but still would refuse to explain how it works nowadays. 
Here are some examples.
> Freedle identified seven factors that seemed to affect the difficulty of  a test question. One of the most common was simple word repetition. If  an answer had a word in it that also appeared in the question, more test  takers chose it; thus a question was easier if it contained a word that  recurred in the correct answer, and harder if it contained a word that  recurred in an incorrect answer. In reading-comprehension questions  another factor was where in a reading passage the key part appeared. If  it was at the beginning or the end of the passage, the question was  easier than if it was in the middle.

My questions are, why is this bad and how is it discriminatory?
Another one from the same article:
> It had too many psychometric tricks <...> Atkinson thought were  irrelevancies—for example, is ""entomology to insects"" more like  ""agriculture to cows"" or ""pedagogy to education""? 
Why is this question a psychometric trick and not a valid test of the students' formal logic skills?
Other instances are more anecdotal. I had a discussion with someone claiming to be a teacher from California. Their example was a test question that mentioned a stand mixer, which is classist: affluent students are more likely to have one at home. I was not convinced; they said that really good examples are not public and refused to even hint what they might look like.
So, how does discrimination in standardized tests work?

(I have no idea why it's called the ""Gamma Bias"".)
The meat of the article is the following:
>*Gamma bias operates within a matrix of four possible judgments about gender: doing good (celebration), doing harm (perpetration), receiving good (privilege) and receiving harm (victimhood). The theory predicts that within mainstream western cultures, masculinity is highlighted only in the domain of 'privilege' and 'perpetration' but hidden in the domains of 'celebration' and 'victimhood'. This means for example that the heroism performed mainly by men (e.g. firemen) will be gender neutralised ('firefighters') by the inclusion of a small minority of women, whereas a much larger proportion of female perpetrators and male victims will be excluded from our highly gendered narratives and policies about sexual and domestic violence.*  
>  
>*Such cognitive distortions, we believe, are leading to a systematic exaggeration of the negative aspects of men and masculinity within mainstream culture, and a minimisation of positive aspects. These embedded distortions could be having a significantly harmful impact on the psychological health of boys and men and therefore on our society as a whole, including the psychology profession.* 
**I think it's important to add that this is not a bias that has been created by feminism, I'd argue that this is a bias that plagues society in general.**
Now the overwhelming majority of firefighters are male, that is true. But one could argue that this is because women have historically been barred from becoming firefighters due to them being perceived as weaker.
I do agree with the claim that many narratives and policies about sexual and domestic violence do leave out men as victims, and I believe we need to change that.
I also agree with the claim that the possible exaggeration of negative aspects of men can have significantly harmful impacts on the mental health of boys and men, though especially on the mental health of boys in particular.
Now I'm curious of ~~things~~ your opinion on this topic. What do you think of the Gamma Bias? Do you think it has legitimate concerns? Why or why not?","It sounds like a restatement of gender roles and masculinity under patriarchy.

My ""question,"" if it can be referred to as such, is more a broad inquiry related to a want for resources. I looked around the subreddit but didn't see a categorized readings list.)
As someone who works in academia, particularly in the field of criminology/criminal justice, feminist theory is rarely utilized, at least in my research (criminology has many theories, most of which don't have a lot to do with feminism; though, there are feminist criminologists, but not as a majority, in my experience). So, while I've read a number of feminist works, I would like to read more.
In particular, I am looking for the ""best"" books with the ""best"" arguments related to the following topics:
**- Intersectional feminism.**
**- Liberal feminism (may not always incorporate a lot of critical race theory, so I'm holding it as distinct).**
**- Victimology (not necessarily inherently feminist, but common in feminist research).**
**- Rape culture (may relate to the above).**
**- Theories on patriarchy.**
**- Theory on kyriarchy.**
**- Sexism as \[power\] + \[prejudice\] or macro-level phenomenon, rather than as a micro-level phenomenon.**
**- The wage gap.**
**- The ""Me Too"" movement (or, the concept of believing women, generally).**
(I may have forgotten a few concepts, so I'll take anything on important feminist theory or ideas as an overall ""other"" pull.)
Thank you!","Quite a research project you have going there.  Based on your interests in institutional sexism and criminology I can think of a few books you might find helpful.
For intersectionality, check out Angela Davis *Women Race & Class* and bell hooks *Feminist Theory From Margin to Center*.  Both include analyses of how the hierarchies and power structures built into patriarchy create a violent culture, and are decent descriptions of kyriarchy as well.
For rape culture, check out Rebecca Solnit's essay collection *Men Explain Things to Me*, particularly the essays ""The Longest War,"" ""Cassandra Among the Creeps,"" and ""Pandora's Box and the Volunteer Police Force.""   Another good one is the essay anthology *Ask : Building Consent Culture* edited by Kitty Stryker.
For patriarchy, sources from sociology and anthropology are good.  I liked Friedrich Engels *Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State* and Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha *Sex at Dawn*.
There are other places where feminism and criminology intersect as well, including the modern prison abolition movement as it relates to feminism and dismantling violent patriarchal culture, and the psychological tradition analyses of women's criminality which go back to Freud and Pollak and which you probably already know, and in modern times would be more informed by an understanding of patriarchy and institutional sexism.  Those are hot topics and there's lots of good essays and shorter articles on those subjects online if you're interested.

* For starters, one should look at the foundation of America when it was formed - it was meant to be the ideal place of libertarianism, except for a few demographics who had limited rights such as women [(particularly married women)](https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/essay/legal-status-women-1776%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C1830), [Native Americans](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-amgovernment/chapter/civil-rights-for-indigenous-groups-native-americans-alaskans-and-hawaiians/), and the [African Americans](https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/colonial-america-american-revolution-learning-resources/american-revolution-essays-timelines-images/african-americans-and-the-american-revolution/) (who were still slaves at the time)
* Similar to the ironies mentioned above, there are still a few mentalities that still persist even though certain mentalities have been tackled with in the past since the Civil Rights Movements such as [racism against African Americans](https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes#section-0) (although racist attitudes have decreased throughout the decades), [attitudes towards Muslims](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/) (which is still somewhat in the middle, not overall positive) and [attitudes towards immigrants](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/12/americans-immigration-policy-priorities-divisions-between-and-within-the-two-parties/) (which is divided between both parties)
* Attitudes towards war as America is often are often divided into two - [those who see America as a global police](https://www.npr.org/2008/02/20/19180589/should-america-be-the-worlds-policeman) and while also seen as a [warmonger because of its military-industrial complex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325813242_Military_Industrial_Complex_A_catalyst_for_conflicts_and_wars); or similar to America being seen as advocate for peace, there is still an issue about [purchasing firearms in America](https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/19/news/guns-background-checks/index.html) and [gun control](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12485) and incidents[ involving firearms in America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081)
* Attitudes towards alcohol in America are both [revered](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/americans-alcohol-study_n_598dcce8e4b09071f69932fd) yet also [stigmatised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998202/)
* Attitudes towards sex in America are both [revered](https://www.deseret.com/2011/7/31/20206966/sex-and-television-how-america-went-from-i-love-lucy-to-playboy-club#zooey-deschanel-top-stars-with-damon-wayans-jr-jake-johnson-max-greenfield-and-hannah-simone-in-new-girl) or [accepted](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/changes-americans-attitudes-sex-reviewing-40-years-data/) and also [stigmatised](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/genderandsexualitylawblog/files/2012/04/Sexual-Stigma-and-Sexual-Prejudice-in-the-United-States-A-Conceptual-Framework.pdf) (although this study is a bit old)

I cannot think of any more ironies to point out but I feel the pattern is clear - it is as though the culture of America has lots of ironies ... how come?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Both shows that I love growing up and now (I am a Cis Straight Mexican Boy who is middle class though, I am the target of most things).
And they kinda elucidated me in politics.   I started politics from there, more South Park than IASIP.  It pushed me left along with Comics and Youtubers.

So here's the question.  This is from an IASIP episode (trigger warning, black kids get shot) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGx12bpJc18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGx12bpJc18)

The episode is about the gang being ""The Wiz""ed into black bodies and living their experience.  Through out the episode they learn a bunch of after school special lessons about not judging each other and not being prejudice but the end as seen above kinda highlights the problem with that stuff.  Totally valid lessons, but they aren't the problem.  People get shot in the street for their skin color and that's the problem.  It's a systemic issue.

So at what point is Edgy Humor harmful or helpful?  The IASIP did kinda underline the problem for me but a lot of other people found it far too realistic and too graphic.  Black kid gets shot by the police.  And from there a bunch of other things.  Even the black face episode leads to a discussion on why Black Face is racists and how racism permeates even to well meaning liberals.  But it's still Blackface.

The modern understanding is that it refers to one's gender identity. I think it's fair to say the words ""man"" and ""woman"" has undergone somewhat of a definitional paradigm shift. That is the modern understanding of the words.
The terms ""racism"" and ""sexism"" were coined in sociology to refer to institutional oppression based on race and sex. As such, sociologically speaking, it would be impossible for white men to be the victim of either racism or sexism given that they are not an oppressed group. However, the modern understanding of the words ""racism"" and ""sexism"" refer simply to prejudice based on race and sex respectively. As such, white men *can* be the victims or both racism and sexism. That is the modern understanding of the words.
I've noticed among left-leaning circles such as AskFeminists, people are eager to comply to the new definitions of man and woman yet insist on sticking to the original definitions of racism and sexism. Why is that? Why should our language ""evolve"" in some instances to accommodate how terms are used in modern society yet in other instances, vehemently stick to the original definitions of words?","The terms racism and sexism were not originally coined in sociology, they were both coined by random people. The dictionary definitions of the words are not a theoretical advancement from the sociological definition but just a simplified explanation absent of any sort of theory. The first definition of racism and sexism in the Miriam-Webster dictionary, for example, are both the definitions used when the respective word was first created. Critical theory wasn't even developed until much later than the term racism. So the short answer is we aren't refusing to accept some kind of new understanding of the words, it isn't new",14

Human beings are capable of so many things, both incredible and terrible, and will believe in so many things and will continue to find ways to justify or reinforce their beliefs no matter how absurd they may seem in the eyes of others.

And for the most part, some conspiracies have actually been confirmed after they have been debated for so long - [the Watergate scandal](https://www.history.com/topics/1970s/watergate), [Project Stargate](https://www.history.com/news/cia-esp-espionage-soviet-union-cold-war), [the Tuskegee Study](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/faq.htm),[the Rotherham sexual exploitation scandal](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-45980210), etc ...
These were all founded or influenced by some sort of entity or authority (mostly political) that they were quote-unquote ""official"" and verified years after they had happened which makes a lot of sense why people would assume that some things are systematically orchestrated to look like a particular way but in reality are a cover-up of some kind.
It is no wonder that there are so many anti-authority messages in many forms of media nowadays or with messages that involve level of conspiracy like in novels there are 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, etc; in comic books there are the stories of the Watchmen and the famous tales of the Marvel Civil War and the Dark Knight Returns storyline; in TV there are Mr. Robot, Westworld, etc; in video games there are Deus Ex and Bioshock and so on.

So conspiracy theory-based stories have been pretty ingrained in today's culture whether the trope is done to address a certain message to the audience or whether it is a way of making the story more interesting.
Nonetheless, people still find a way to suggest that there is some level of shady stuff happening in the backgrounds of something because even though we try to find reason or some sort of logic in any kind of structure, the world behaves in many strange and chaotic ways and people will still believe that it is impossible for the world to behave in such a way and will try to make up some sort of pattern when there isn't any - [proportionality bias](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/account-for-proportionality-bias-big-63232/).

And sometimes, these conspiracy theories may appear to be sound at first glance even though they have been debunked multiple times -
\- The moon landing conspiracy that states that the Americans faked the moon landing as a form of propoganda to outbeat the Soviets during the Space Race but judging by the technology of the time, it could not be done
\- The conspiracy theory of the COVID-19 pandemic that people believe that it was pre-planned to control the population by some kind but according to the research done so far, the source came from a wet market where contamination is heavy high and the globalisation of the world of today made us more suspectible to the spread and contamination of the virus
\- The conspiracy about the MMR vaccine and the link with autism is motivated by a debunked study that is probably reinforced by concerned parents who fear that the medical industry are doing this to profit from the sicknesses of others but has been debunked multiple times.

So it does not provoke me to claim that these conspiracy theories are false and stupid at first glance considering that I am aware that shady stuff have happened before and how the world behaves in many complicated ways. But at the same time, I am aware that humans have a habit of trying to make links to things when there is none or will look too deep into something when they do not need to and because of this, it can be very difficult to differentiate between real problems that are not being highlighted in the current mainstream; from conspiracy theories that could potentially harm the mainstream thought of the general population","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

I feel like «sexism» is more of a general term that describes prejudice based on all genders, while misogony and misandry is more specific. What are your opinions? :)",N/A,N/A

Please no comments by people who haven't seen the movie and are just spreading their bias. Thanks.","For a documentary, it's very one-sided, and Cassie Jaye displayed very little journalistic curiosity. Overall it struck me as amateurish propaganda-- especially because it was funded by manosphere-type groups-- and it was obviously biased and just not very well done.
For example, a decent interviewer doing a real documentary would have pushed some of the men being interviewed on the toxic/misogynist parts of the MRM-- even if she did want to portray the MRM in a better light. Instead, she fell all over herself to either defend or completely ignore the misogynist rhetoric, and to portray men like Paul Elam as sympathetic, emotionally vulnerable, pleasant father figures who just want what's best for everyone.
She also (rather dishonestly) employs a lot of selective editing when she talks about things like adoptions and father's rights, and to put the few feminists who do appear in a very negative light-- the individual feminists are portrayed as uptight, prickly, out-of-touch, and even slightly unhinged; and the anti-MRA rallies and protests are looped, edited, and spoken about as though they are much larger, much more frequent, and much more violent than they ever were. She does not question why they're upset, or what they're upset about-- instead leaving the viewer to conclude that they must just hate men.
She also doesn't identify, or even attempt to identify, any systemic causes for issues facing men and boys. She just says ""men have it worse than women do,"" throws out a couple of statistics, and leaves it at that, as though that should suffice as an explanation.

That somehow queens and empresses didn't start wars or oppress the men below them... that men didn't die in every war for their mothers and sisters to stay home... It seems like even now when people look at the differences between men and women they use it to divide and conquer.

But are women's and men's rights fundamentally different? Is it possible for rational man or woman without strong bias like misogyny or misandry to represent opposite sex voters as well?,"I don't think there should be any difference in rights between men and women.
Firstly, the biological differences don't always match up with gender in the way we assume. There are men who can get pregnant and menstruate, and there are women who can ejaculate. Basically any biological feature that people assume is a man trait, there are people with that trait who aren't men, and the same for anything people assume is a woman trait.
People with different biological sex characteristics sometimes have different needs because of those, and that should be respected, but in most cases I don't see it being important to have different rights as a result. We could just as easily say ""everyone has the right to free access to period products"" and not worry about the fact that only some of those people actually need period products. If you set out a ""take one if you need one"" display of period products, people who aren't menstruating are unlikely to take them very often. And there are rare cases where they might need them - eg people recovering from injuries or surgery in the genital region might use pads to deal with any bleeding. If we err on the side of more widespread accessibility rather than less, we allow for people with needs we might not have anticipated.
For medical care, people have different medical needs that should be determined on an individual basis, and not just based on their gender or sex. For example, a trans woman who is on long-term HRT is likely to need both regular prostate exams and breast exams.

As a result of the recent political climate, I drafted a letter to the Dean of my engineering school to demand the hiring of tenure-track Black faculty to my department (none in the history of our department yet we have a substantial number of Black undergrads who lack mentorship and representation from someone of shared experience). We had over 100 undergrads, graduate students, postdocs, and alumni sign it.
The Dean welcomed a meeting with some student representatives and some administrative people. In short, we learned that they have intentions to hire Black and URM faculty but they have racist and ignorant perceptions of how to go about it. 
One of the professors in our department who said he's been in the faculty hiring process for 17 years now and that the main reason why we don't have Black faculty is because *there are not enough Black faculty candidates who apply*. And then the head of our department *agreed*. Which is absolutely ridiculous. Like ""it's not our fault! Black people are just not smart enough for STEM to get on our shortlist!"" We know for a fact there have been Black faculty candidates who have made it to the Dean's desk and those offers fell short without the final push. Many other universities have done it, why can't we? And if you've been in the process for 17 years, why can't you recognize *you're part of the problem?*
Another issue was their perception of the environment in my department being welcoming for Black students and Black faculty. There have been instances of racist comments that were reported but never dealt with. There have been instances of racist microaggressions by professors that occurred over and over and never dealt with. These were never reported for fear of retaliation, so there's no record. The admin just kept going on and on about how our department and our engineering school is so welcoming and supportive of students and faculty.
Sorry for the rant, but tldr, these people clearly have a warped perception of the problem and refuse to recognize blame. Before the meeting, we were told not to be aggressive or accusatory or else they'd shut down. We even had slides prepared that buttered up the current Dean and praise her for her work on hiring women faculty. **How do we get these people to confront bias, accept blame, recognize that we need to change the department and school environment and fix the hiring process to make it more welcoming and supportive for Black academics?**","Hi there,
I am in academia (have been for 20+ years) and have sat on many, many search committees for faculty members. What you want is a good thing, but your Dean is also not wholly wrong in trying to explain some of the reasons why it’s not so easy as it appears. (I am not saying they could not do better, but there are some things about the process that you don’t understand or for which you are attributing malicious intent where none probably exists.)
It is absolutely true that when you advertise a position, the vast majority of people who apply — and applications for faculty positions can easily run in the hundreds for one position — are not people of color. (Or, sometimes they are, but if they don’t mention it in their materials, it’s not apparent. When applying, HR departments usually ask applicants to fill out an AA form, but we on the hiring committee never see the results of that form.) This is not an indication that people in your department think “black people are not smart enough to get on our shortlist”, unless that is something that someone in your department explicitly said. The pipeline from thinking “I’d like to get a PhD in X and maybe teach college” to actually getting a tenure-track job takes years, so if there are still not enough people of color coming out at the narrow end of the hiring funnel now, it’s because there weren’t enough going in at the wide end of the funnel 10 years ago. This has been a long-standing problem in academia. Additionally, especially in the sciences, there are often industry jobs that people with PhDs can do that pay more than teaching college, so at various points in that funnel, people may be lost to higher-paying options outside of academia. 
In recent years, most colleges have made proactive efforts to advertise their open positions in the journals/job-lists of professional societies of people of color as well as through the big national disciplinary organizations, trying to get more people into the wide end of the funnel. Same goes for attracting candidates who are women. 
And yes, it may well be that Black candidates have gotten to the finalist stage and not ended up being hired, but there are so many reasons that that might have happened that you will never find out about, not because they’re nefarious, but because they’re confidential. Person A got another offer elsewhere that they liked more. Person B needed a spousal hire that couldn’t be accommodated. Person C, after visiting our campus, didn’t really like the town. Person D requested more money in salary or startup costs than the school could provide. Person E wants a 1-1 teaching schedule and we’re a 3-3 school. Person F looked great on paper and then they came for the interview and taught a sample class and it turns out they have no idea how to teach undergrads, which is what we really need. Person G said, “yeah, I don’t want to be your token professor of color who is asked to mentor this ‘substantial number’ of Black undergrads — that’s a ton of unpaid emotional labor which will get me no extra pay and zero progress towards tenure.” 
Person G has a point there, which you also raise: if you want to attract Black faculty, you have to already be providing a campus atmosphere that is supportive of Black faculty. So yes, the department atmosphere needs to be corrected before you have a real chance at hiring more faculty of color — because let’s be clear: no one wants to come into a situation where they not only have to do their regular job, but they also have to fix the racial bias and play the role of unpaid advisor to all underrepresented students, especially for how comparatively little academia pays compared to industry and how hard it is at some schools to get tenure. If there is a student ombudsperson on campus, that is a good way to raise concerns anonymously. (I’m surprised that these concerns about racist comments weren’t mentioned on student course evaluations, which are anonymous at most schools.)
One final note: ultimately, search processes are overseen by HR, and must run according to HR’s rules. It might be illuminating for you to ask the HR people to do a presentation for you on how they see these issues and how they play out in the search process.",8

Ideas can only be as complex as language can accommodate for.,"Do you think there is some merit to that? 
That because we can only think in terms of language, language we didn’t create personally, our thoughts then are limited to the connotations and meanings attached to whatever language we have been taught?
Personally I agree. I think communication right now is very limited. 
If person A wants to communicate a complex idea to person B, they have to compress that idea into a verbal description. 
Then person B has to receive that verbal description through their ears and hopefully not mishear what was said. 
Then person B has to decompress the spoken description of the idea person A is trying to communicate and then from there try to understand what person A means by what they have said.
Not very effective. We all know this, how easily miscommunications happen—in both verbal and written communication.
Okay, now with all this in mind, I’m gonna throw one more question at you;
Elon Musk just had a press release recently for his prototype “neurolink” that he claims will initially aid people with brain injuries.
Neurolink, according to Musk, will be a tiny, cylindrical component that would be implanted in our brain by removing a small, and I mean really small, piece of skull and then replacing that space with the neurolink. 
Microscopic wires would extend from the device into specific areas of the brain to assist with forming new neural pathways and strengthening weakened ones.
This is a very laymen’s explanation obviously because I am not a neuroscientist.
Musk says that the major application of this neurolink device in the beginning will be to allow disabled persons to regain function of their limbs, cure Alzheimer’s and dementia, and even recall memories with machine accuracy. 
Musk says that eventually people with the neurolink installed will be able to communicate to each other “post-verbally.” 
This literally means that we will finally be able to communicate without having to rely on language. 
A complex idea or thought or experience that you just don’t have the words to describe, you just link up to someone else who also has a neurolink and instantly they would be able to understand how you’re feeling; it’d be like two brains sharing the same space and communicating as fast as supercomputers. 
My question is, would society benefit from this type of communication? If the majority of people ended up getting this neurolink implant, would society become more empathetic? 
A person who has been raised to be racist or sexist their whole life could link up with a person of color or a woman and instead of having a debate, their feelings, experiences, perspectives would be shared with each other. Both persons would know the other person completely. 
I strongly believe that hatred and prejudice is born out of ignorance. So eliminating the ignorance we all have of each other’s lives would surely help us all become more understanding of each other.
But that’s just my opinion, I wanna know yours!
Do you agree with Alan Watts about the limitations  that language puts on communication or conceptualizing ideas?
Do you think that society would become more empathetic and less hateful if “post-verbal” communication becomes the major mode of communication?","I think that while I'd agree on the basic premise that part of the reason bigotry exists is because of ignorance, the problem is that an entirely different beast altogether is willfull ignorance, which in my experience as a trans person accounts for a good amount of bigotry.
If people want to stay in their ignorant bubble and denying reality, no amount of anything will break them out of it, for a lot of people bigotry is ingrained in their worldview to the point that they need it to make sense of the world. And another thing is that empathy isn't taught or encouraged in a lot of people (mostly men) so I don't think it would be an expectable tool to get them out of their bigotry.",6

Feminists continue to advocate and organize using the word ""feminism."" 
It's not a novel concept to advocate for equality or justice. For people to be pulled into a movement, there needs to be work put behind it so if self labeled ""egalitarians"" feel they have a just enough cause for action then I'd be willing to see what their plans are and join them. 
As it stands, however, it often seems egalitarianism is used as a rebuttal to feminism, LGBT rights advocacy, and civil rights activism. The people in these movements already are in on the fight and are directing their efforts. I haven't really seen great examples of egalitarians doing the same.
People I've met who self-label as egalitarian don't seem to have that fire and I kind of condemn them for not putting their money where their mouth is. If you see injustice and are not putting the work in to fight it then what are you asking of others? Claims of things being hard or people fighting against you doesn't really cut it for me because a lot of activism is putting yourself in danger, slogging through emotionally trying and difficult situations, or tolerating insufferable things just to maybe get a little of what you want done. 
I see no real utility in giving up the history and work behind the word feminism for a concept that has no work behind it.

I didn’t imagine that this bias was nearly as harmful as race or religion. Why is it wrong to find overweight people unattractive...perhaps lazy is another bias? It seems like they would have the power to control their weight, so if they don’t, they deserve it? The only thing I can come up with is that weight loss requires specific education (ebooks and programs), gym memberships, mid budget meals, and access to health care, which is a monetary barrier that some low-income people can’t afford.

I am looking for advice and possibly some source feminist reading material from this group. I would like to find sources to refer to so that I can be more informed when it comes to conversations about the historical contributions of women. For context, I am a demi-bisexual woman getting a Ph.D. in a male-dominated field in STEM. Yesterday I was having a conversation with a male friend of mine from college.  He is an educated ex-marine, and I think fairly progressively in his beliefs. I told him that I enjoyed having female friends more than male friends because my female friends have historically been more supportive of me than male friends. I also admitted that I do have a few male friends, but overall I don't enjoy the ""every man for himself"" mentality I have encountered among male friendships. Men tend to bond through competition. Women tend to bond through conversation. I remember learning this concept in my gender studies class in undergrad. Is it possible I learned it incorrectly? He told me that my statements were problematic because men have historically worked together beautifully and are just as supportive as women if not in different ways. I was a bit surprised that he would say this. He said that I was more or less ""making stuff up"" based on my personal bias, but I was thinking about how women have historically been assigned a role in the home to support and raise families while men have been given positions of power.  I was unsure about how to approach the conversation. Does anyone have any reading material I could look at to have more informed conversations about gender dynamics and the supportive role that women have historically played in our society? It's been a long time since I have read a feminist text. I would like to broach the subject with him again after some preparation. How might I have this conversation constructively?","Some books that I would recommend:
* *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center* by bell hooks
   * This book covers a wide range and functions as an introduction. 
      * It benefits by giving a clear and quotable definition of Feminism: as the Movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.
      * It critiques some earlier feminist thinking and where it went wrong. Mainly the white liberal feminism that didn't notice the existence of Women of color in the workforce.
      * It covers how men are and can also be victims to sexist oppression.
* *Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics* by bell hooks
   * Another introductory book by hooks.
      * This book covers a wider range of topics while the previous looked at the feminist movement and how it could benefit from starting at the margins of society instead of being centered on white women, that a white women feminism is victim to white supremacy.
      * This book covers such things as Politics, Education, Class Struggle, Global Feminism, Reproductive Rights, Marriage, Feminist Parenting, Feminist Masculinity, and more
      * This book and the previous help to show the reader how the perception of Feminism was shaped by our patriarchal media system. This is not a conspiracy theory; rather, the media was able to choose Feminist idols that were visible and easy to tear down as wacky.
* *The Essential Feminist Reader* by Estelle B. Freedman
   * This is a collection of works organized chronologically by Freedman
      * You wanted something that would show the historical presence of women, and this book can do that. 
      * The earliest document in this book comes from Christine De Pizan, France, 1405. Although, most of its documents come from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
      * This book is not just European and American, it includes sources from India, China, Mexico, Zimbabwe and more.
      * The entries are all rather short, and some are more philosophical and other are more literary. 
      * I have only read selections out of it, so I don't know how helpful it would be in specific situations of conflict.
These are all simple books I'd recommend. One book that I'm not recommending because I never see it quoted and I believe it may be sort of out of date is *Women's Choices: Philosophical Problems Facing Feminism* by Mary Midgley and Judith Hughes. The reason, however, why I bring it up is that the authors said something that has stuck with me. When they were writing the book, pre-1983, the feminist movement, as they saw it, has a strange relation with history. As the authors say, 
>Many members of the current women's movement, including some of its prophets, have recorded that when they began their work they thought they were breaking entirely new ground. They did not know they had predecessors at all, and were often delighted to discover them. (pg. 121)
Be delighted to find them, and unlike the authors, for they continue in negative manner from this, make them common knowledge. And as common knowledge as something we can call upon immediately instead of having to search for. Hope this helps.",4

The reasoning I generally see behind such statements is that ""men hold power and privilege over women, and that they use this power to oppress and abuse women. So these phrases are battlecry against oppression and hence justified.""
But to me, it feels like a case of *stereotyping* an entire gender with being part of oppression and abuse.
And this reasoning also fits into the definition of sexism: ***prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex.***
Another concerning thing is that using this reasoning even seemingly racists slogans like ""Muslims are trash""  or ""I hate muslims"" can be justified because women and minorities are often oppressed in Islamic countries.
Don't you think better slogans can be made for the cause of opposing oppression? Like sexist men are trash or something else.

I will make my unbiased argument. NOTE: the context of this is argument needs to be stated so nobody gets confused. I think abortions are fine and women should be able to. We are going to be discussing when one party wants to keep the baby and the other doesn't.
I agree that if the woman wants the child, she should ALWAYS be allowed to keep it. You should never force an abortion on someone.
But if the man wants to keep the child, too bad  ""mY BoDY mY CHoICE, PEriodt""
So, no matter what, according to your rules, the man has no say over the survival of his own child. People often forget it takes two to make a child. And making the blanket statement ""it should always be the woman's choice"" enables a lot of bad women to take advantage of the unequal power. Also it's HIS DNA  too ""his body"" and it's his biological/physiological property should be respected just like any other form.  Just because your pregnant doesn't make him any less of a parent. Now I think most women could agree/empathize with men that it's unfair in the scenario i presented above that if a man wanted to keep the child he couldn't but a women could. 
These are the facts: There is an inequality when it comes to the decision whether to abort or not. 
I've seen many solutions to this grey area/ inequality from lots of people, such as If the mother doesn't want it because it will be such a ""burden on her life"" then give it to the father who would want the baby instead of getting an abortion and killing the baby when the father would've happily raised it. Although I agree it is wrong. You cant force someone to hold your baby for you "" No women should have to go through 9 months of pain"" yes I agree but no man should have to deal with the loss and trauma of losing his child. But you cant force someone to give birth, the same way you cant force a man to pay child support.  Men is that unfair/unequal YES ABSOLUTELY. but there's nothing that can really be done with that. Off topic: but in general nobody is really equal or treated the same. that's just life. 
At the end of the day women should have the final say But it shouldn't be 100 percent their decision. More like Men should have 50 percent and women have 60 percent, and that extra 10 percent is just because they have reproductive rights / they carry the baby. ( i know math wise it doesn't make sense but u get what i mean)
BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE
is that yes on a legal/government level women should have the final say. 100 percent agree because even if the government did side with men on the scenario above a government still  just cant force a women to give birth neither, too many problems arise on that level.  
BUT HE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE
is that when it comes to the abortion dispute. Social media and other toxic pro life members like to silence men or simply tell them to shut the fuck up. Men should have some say when it comes to abortions because at the end of the day it's their child too. Should women have the final say, Yes absolutely. But we need to make sure Men feel that their voices are heard too and are part of the overall discussion. Not this elementary school bullshit. Granted the couple in question is in some sort of committed relationship. Obviously men shouldn't have a say if he was a rapist or if it was just some one night stand type of deal. But if not, then men absolutely should have some say.
and i do think if a man wants to keep the baby but the women doesn't.  I don't think Its SUPER far fetched for the women to give birth and give the baby to the man, she doesn't have to raise it/ pay child support or event be a guardian. And yes i already know ""But giving birth is horrible and you might die from it,  it's  not worth it just so the MAN can get his offspring "" First off if she's okay/agrees with this method then it's fine. But if she doesn't want to give birth, then yes she doesn't have to give birth BUT most pregnancies will not result  in death some do happen yes but it's not HIGHLY LIKELY. At most you will have minor physical damage to your bones. 
It should at least be considered as an option between the two partners.
the decision of whether to abort or not should BE between the two partners. Only. nobody else.","Sorry, we don’t do rants. Take it somewhere else.",1

In responding to the above article, I wrote:
'Not basing this on any science, but I don't think it's immutable at all. Sexuality is fluid. Not even necessarily between male/female, but I know I personally go through phases when I prefer girls of a certain body type. Utterly ignore big boobed chicks for more slender, cute butted girls then sometimes crave more full-bodied ones and everything in between. 
Again this isn't based on science, but you mention some of the sources in your post are biased. Even without purposeful bias, science/stats can be biased inherently by the subjects they pick and their willingness to answer honestly. If they are experiencing something they can't confront honestly with themselves, internally, their answers are not as reliable also.
The Kinsey scale (0-6) suggests most of us are somewhere in the middle, neither heterosexual or exclusively homosexual. While somewhat outdated, it's important because it considers sexuality as a continuum and not binary. 
I think the immutable aspect of sexuality is not in sexuality itself, but society's lag in redefining the views and labels around sexuality. People might be fluid in their sexuality and want to experience a different sex or stray from their norm, but because of society still labeling sexuality as binary it's difficult. If a person did want to venture out sexually, they might have an interest or curiosity but that doesn't outweigh the risk of them changing their sexual label to the rest of the world. Not worth having an experience to satisfy some curiosity only to be labeled as gay and then have a horrific time finding partners of a prefered sex. 
So I think sexuality is not immutable at all. I do think that sexual identify, not to ourselves but how others view us, is quite immutable and affects sexuality. Our attractions are still the same, but our unwillingness to alter our sexual identity to the world around us locks us into the binary sexual identities of old.'
Got removed for not having a source. I'm an intelligent and educated person who reads and said that as honest as I could. I don't think my take was racy or absurd, and cited Kinsey so it wasn't only my own take.
Moreover, op admitted his citations were biased. So I spoke to that.

>Most child abusers are women, based on CPS estimates that are primarily concerned with physical and sexual abuse.

After all, they're our mothers. We're supposed to love them unconditionally for everything they did for us and look past their faults and abuses.

>You're backtracking from your original claim that emotional violence is just as or more potent a weapon than physical violence. To the extent that men are more physically violent, I would note that ""boys will be boys"" - a sentiment I have only ever heard expressed by women - cuts both ways. Boys are allowed (by their predominately female caretakers) to get away with things girls are not allowed to get away with, but they are also expected to fend and stand up for themselves in a way that girls are not. When authority won't help, boys on the playground learn that violence is sometimes the only way to ensure their safety and emotional well-being. That doesn't justify their violence as adults - especially violence in intimate relationships - but that brings us back to the original question of agency in the internalization of gender roles.

Honestly answering this question re-quires tracing the history of both the theory and practice of domestic violence law. Undertaking such an exploration, one quickly finds that the “discovery” of domestic violence is rooted in the essential feminist tenet that society is controlled by an all-encompassing patriarchal structure.8 This fundamental feminist understanding of domestic violence has far-reaching implications. By dismissing the possibility of female violence, the framework of legal programs and social norms is narrowly shaped to respond only to the male abuse of women. Fe-male batterers cannot be recognized. Male victims cannot be treated. If we are to truly address the phenomenon of domestic violence, the legal response to domestic violence and the biases which underlie it must be challenged.*

All citizens have the same rights and should be given the same possibilities of development, even if those possibilities should be adapted onto any individual specific limitations, as that no one gets neglected, cultural institutions should work as a form of confederacy, with no symbolic, privately owned institutional property, meaning it lacking an spatial reinforcement, meaning the absence of an individual characterization of politics, a strong legislative body that would be detached of a cultural bias, the creation of an universal legislative system/body based on the internet that could enforce local legislation, eliminating specialization in industries, and as so a fixed schedule, people should work on different industries, no privately owned company would be taxed as long as it reinforced workers rights and were regulated by a ecological legislature, the industry should only produce significant things, that would advance the development and optimization of society, anything else should be deterred, the creation of a state owned mall, that could centralize consuming any goods, a monthly package of food, clothes, medicine and any other health related goods distributed free by the government to any citizen, a housing law recognizing housing as a universal right, buying any of the small businesses that do not produce any of the previously named indispensable goods, and making them state owned apartments, limiting the qualities of any house, stopping luxury development, no privately owned housing market, only individuals can buy property, different economic systems, a bond market based on the value of production of basic commodities, the creation of a food bank that could regulate the difference of a production value per community, food can not be capitalized, still with an external market of secondary commodities, a regional, community driven industry that is only agricultural, the reduction of states to the extent of urban development, the creation of an indigenous state and of national parks, with no spatial recognition but that of itself as an independent sanctuary, renewable energies, electrical transportation based primarily on trains, the communications should not be privately owned, nor can they distribute any type of ideological perspective/reinforcement, no opinion but a pragmatic exposition, a publicly owned radio free of capitalization, an acceptance of migration and political refugees, with the creation of small communities integrated with the native citizens, a strong background check and the possibility of acquiring a temporal nationality after 6 moths of working, that would be revoked after they stop working, a reform to the hymn and flag if those promoted violence, expansionism or any form of chauvinism related behavior, including xenophobia, all education should be militarized, with the dissolution of a military, instead a police encompassing all citizens of a given area, with strong reforms to fanaticism, sexism, and violation of human rights, most importantly no military force should have more power or extent that any other, and as so there should be a regulation as the extent of population per community, disenfranchised military movements that pertain to the structure of a regional congress, the penal system should have at its core the idea of reforming people with lesser offense, any sort of physical or psychological violence should be treated as mayor aggression, that depending on the extent of it (any form of torture, mutilation, sexual violence, killing, and other act that would impede the normal life of the people affected) would end with people not being able to reintegrate to society, living in a prison with no basic rights, were they should produce their own food, with no commodities of any kind, nor the possibility of having any contact with people from outside.","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

>Because the arrest rate of blacks for offenses that don’t “hinge on police discretion,” like violent crimes, also systematically exceeds their proportion of the population. In other words, so far as we can tell with objective statistics, the plain fact is that the color of crime in Ferguson is black.
There are three elements to this story.
>Tracking how the population changed in Ferguson over a 40 year period
Understanding how white flight effectively forces police to become a source of revenue
>Researching crime rates to see if white police are behaving in a discriminatory manner when it comes to non-“discretional” crimes like murder or robbery.
First, properly to understand crime figures, you have to realize that Ferguson, Missouri is a community devastated by sudden white flight. 
>The city is currently 70 percent black, but this is a very recent development.
>In 1970,Ferguson was 99 percent white  
>In 1980, Ferguson was 85 percent white and 14 black
>In 1990, Ferguson was 73.8 percent white and 25.1 percent black
>In 2000, Ferguson was 44.8 percent white and 52.4 percent black
>By 2010 Ferguson was 29.3 percent white and 67.4 percent black
>Since the Supreme Court declared Restrictive Covenants on property unconstitutional, and with Federal government openly working to impose diversity on white America through “Fair Housing,” Section 8, refugee resettlement etc., no city can protect itself against the kind of white flight we’ve seen over a 40 year time period in Ferguson.
>Once whites leave the city, the tax base erodes, property values plummet, and only certain kinds of businesses can feasibly stay open and turn a profit.  I call this effect the “Black Undertow.” This is what happened to Ferguson, and the riots have only accelerated the flight of human capital from the city.
>These numbers are nearly a complete match to the crime statistics I pulled from the City of St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Annual Report to the Community, which breaks down the arrests rates for violent crime by race (you can research 1999-2012 at the site).
>In other words, black criminality in and around Ferguson is systematic and long-standing. And as the proportion of blacks in Ferguson rose, the absolute amount of crime increased even more dramatically.
He makes the same point here: https://donotlink.it/1J2lQ
Apparently when blacks move in, they scare the poor decent whites away. 
This has a number of false assumptions in my mind.
First off Blacks never really had the same housing rights of whites: 
https://equalrightscenter.org/source-of-income-and-race-discrimination-dc/ https://thinkprogress.org/study-finds-rampant-discrimination-by-landlords-against-people-who-get-housing-help-98be24c1ecff/ https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/01/section-8-housing-government-low-income-vouchers-renters/579496/ https://www.shareable.net/timeline-of-100-years-of-racist-housing-policy-that-created-a-separate-and-unequal-america/ https://prospect.org/justice/staggering-loss-black-wealth-due-subprime-scandal-continues-unabated/
https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/02/how-segregated-schools-built-segregated-cities/515373/?utm_source=feed https://www.stltoday.com/news/multimedia/special/lending-discrimination-redlining-still-plague-st-louis-new-data-show/article_3e1a6847-799b-58d7-a680-651a0c1a2ea8.html http://www.urbanreviewstl.com/2018/05/opinion-housing-discrimination-remains-an-issue/ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_in_awarding_Section_8_housing
This isn't even getting into how banks were using race-based predatory loans then defaulting on them:
https://www.shareable.net/timeline-of-100-years-of-racist-housing-policy-that-created-a-separate-and-unequal-america/ https://prospect.org/justice/staggering-loss-black-wealth-due-subprime-scandal-continues-unabated/
So this goes a long way towards explaining the lowering of property values. Heck whites were convinced by these same lenders to leave in the first place: https://medium.com/@DmitriMehlhorn/a-requiem-for-blockbusting-68152244e77a
So it's not like blacks could even have the same option of leaving. Large numbers of poor black families live in hyper-segregated neighborhoods with limited access to opportunity.
As for crime rates blacks are increased for the same crimes whites do, but while the later goes free the former gets overly harsh sentences:

https://www.splcenter.org/20180614/biggest-lie-white-supremacist-propaganda-playbook-unraveling-truth-about-%E2%80%98black-white-crime
For another example...
https://crosscut.com/2019/05/report-shows-seattle-police-enforcement-still-disparate-along-racial-lines
https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/9/28/1575387/-Not-only-is-stop-and-frisk-unconstitutional-it-doesn-t-work-no-matter-what-Trump-or-Giuliani-say
Notice how blacks are searched more often yet few weapons are found on them, while it is the reverse for whites?
That’s because not all criminal activity is reported and not all laws are applied equally. Police departments already disproportionately police and surveil poor communities and communities of color.
Certain communities, often white and middle-class, that place greater trust in police departments are more likely to report crimes and Black communities are more likely to be reported as suspected of committing crimes. 
Hell white kids avoid discipline and suspension, while minorities don't! And it isn't because minorities are evil: 
https://www.pnas.org/content/116/17/8255 
https://supportiveschooldiscipline.org/learn/reference-guides/discipline-disparities
We only know about reported and solved crimes, and the bias in favor of white victims of black people is there. Poor, black victims are not generating as much interest, which is known and pretty much incontroversial.
Then there are the cops actively supporting the racists as well: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/police-white-nationalists-racist-violence
https://theintercept.com/2019/08/16/portland-far-right-rally/
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/disturbing-texts-between-oregon-police-far-right-group-prompts-investigation-n972161
There are many ways the crime stats could be skewed.
