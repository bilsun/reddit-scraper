luisrodhino,"hey, this was useful for me, but I have a question: how do you make the additional time.constrained calls?
thanks!",2018-06-14 16:00:22,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/8ejcor/how_can_i_get_all_comments_or_at_least_the/e0nzouy/,pushshift
torb19,"With your help i also tried a different approach. But i actually get a nearly as many comments as submissions. I tried this:
    def getPushshiftComments(after, sub):
      url = 'https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/comment/?         &size=1000&after='+str(after)+'&subreddit='+str(sub)
      r = requests.get(url)
      data2 = json.loads(r.text)
      return data2['data']
    comment_ids = []
    sub='hamburg'
    after = ""1023752000""
    while len(data2) > 0:
      for submission in data2:
          comment_ids.append(submission[""id""])
          help_var = data2[-1]['created_utc']
          date = dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(help_var).strftime('%Y-  %m- %d %H:%M:%S')
          print(date)
          data2 = getPushshiftData(sub=sub, after=data2[-1] ['created_utc'])
I got around 3900 submissions and 4800 comments which is not really realistic and i get a different number with your code.
Do you have any idea why there are such few comments?",2018-04-25 08:30:09,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/8ejcor/how_can_i_get_all_comments_or_at_least_the/dxxllaa/,pushshift

shaggorama,"You're limited to 500 results per API call, but you can go as far back as yi want by making additional time- constrained calls. Here's a lady solution:
    pip installl psaw
    from psaw import PushshiftAPI
    api = PushshiftAPI()
    gen =  api.search_comments(subreddit='fifa')
    comments = list(gen)",2018-04-24 17:17:46,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/8ejcor/how_can_i_get_all_comments_or_at_least_the/dxw83dn/,pushshift

could you give me an example for all comments of the Fifa subreddit?",2018-04-24 12:28:28,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/8ejcor/how_can_i_get_all_comments_or_at_least_the/dxvq9rr/,pushshift
