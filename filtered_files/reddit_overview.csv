You can't be drafted. Sit down when war is discussed"" tweet floating around","This isn't a question but an observation. I know this might not be a great fit but I love this sub and the thoughtful discussion I've seen here.
Obviously this tweet is a silly nonsense attempt at silencing women. But after a discussion with someone about it a few things struck me:
The first is that the laws about drafts were written by men, so to blame women for the draft's gender bias is a little disingenuous 
Also the fact that the tweeter confuses draft with wars. ""Women can't be drafted, so shut up about war."" Drafts and wars may be related but they are different. Women may not be directly effect womem, war certainly does
What really struck me was the idea that, if you are unable to be drafted or haven't served in the military, your opinion is invalid
Extending that logic out a little bit, if women's opnions on war shouldn't be heard because they cant be drafted, why should a man's opinion on war matter if he isn't currently serving, has mever served in the past, or isn't eligible for draft

So I was officially diagnosed as Autistic last year, when I was 18. My councillor wasn't too surprised about this news and had suspected I had something undiagnosed.
The thing is, I've expressed concerns about my mental capabilities during the time I've been around them. (I've been seeing this org since I was 14), and wasn't until I was 17 they've decided to pursue a diagnosis of some kind.
I specifically talked about my lack of focus, frequent dissociation and struggles in academic environments and subjects. This wasn't just a off mention, I talked about it a lot during sessions, and talked to multiple people (teachers, school councillors, social workers).
I was wondering if my late diagnosis  could be due to the [discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_in_medical_diagnosis), in that, I was not taken seriously or pushed away because I present as a woman and/or am a PoC. 
TL:DR ***despite expressing concerns throughout the years, I was only diagnosed last year. Was wondering if this could be due to gender of racial bias***
Thanks and apologises for any mistakes.","There is definitely a gender bias when it comes to the diagnosis of autism as well as ADD/ADHD in women and women-aligned people. A big part of it is that medical professionals look for symptoms that typically manifest in boys and men and do not recognise that these conditions manifest differently in women.   
Diagnosis is also harder for adults in general , since most stereotypical cases of autism and ADD/ADHD are diagnosed when one is very young.",120,1,1,1

For example : internalised misogyny, where 'Pick Me' women will dismiss feminism and attempt to undermine your attempt to educate about how X term or concept is oppressive - what's worse is there'll be a man who'll tag-team with the 'Pick Me' too, so you end up on the losing end of the sexist and woman with internalised misogyny dog-piling. It's frustrating and disheartening.
You see this across all axes - when black people talk about anti-racism there'll be 'house n*****' blaming other black people for police brutality or calling for respectability, when working class talk about poverty there'll be other working class people repeating propoganda about people on benefits, or this post was inspired by a thread dealing with another Autistic person using ableist terms against Autistic people (I was subsequently tag teamed by her and a guy who works with disabled people so thinks he knows best). Sigh. 
It's just so frustrating being stuck in that situation, where people are so willingly prejudice and ignorant towards their own communities. 
Does anyone have any effective strategies for dealing with people like this? 
Also how do you avoid talking over a minority or skidding out of your lane when in the middle of an argument the other person reveals they are part of X group you're discussing?","This may come across as a bit rambling, but the thing I am trying to outline is not clear cut.
Are they being complacent or are they refusing to see themselves as being a victim?
Life is difficult at times and everyone has to get up in the morning and get through the day... almost regardless of what happened to them in the past. In this context an individual may need to see themselves as not be a victim of oppression (regardless of the historical record) but the master of their own fate... they may need this narrative to keep them going in life.
A friend of mine was raped. She, however, didn't go to the police... because she didn't trust them to be able to help... but also because she couldn't (as she described it) allow herself to be a victim. This was entirely separate from what happened, but because she was young, capable and had a goal... for her accepting the status of victim would have changed her. She is the person who walks with confidence into the unknown and takes the bull by the horns. She obviously knows what happened to her, but she has her life to live and in that cannot accept 'victim of rape' in terms of the psychological needs of who she is/wants to be.
Here my point is: the person you are speaking to is also an individual with their own personal life to live. They have a journey they are on, and in this they need to see themselves as being able to take on the burden of that journey. Here the history of racism might be something that would make their personal journey unbearable, so they (for reasons of their own psychology) have to see it is an event of history, but not an event that effects them and their journey.
Remember the facts of history and the psychological narratives of self do not necessarily align. The narrative of self is the story we need to take on the day and journey of our life, that need can trump the facts of the matter.
Do they deny history, or are they focussed on the story they need in order to succeed as they see it?",58,0,0,0

It stems from religion which has a bias against rational thought because it promotes questioning things that don't make sense. 
It actually rewards people that steep themselves within non-rational and anti-intellectual thoughts because they are seen as trailblazers or original-thinkers not adhering to the status quo of facts backed by evidence and repeated results. 
Socially, intellectuals are seen as unexciting and socially inept, which is part of the image that has been fostered in media and social culture in the US.
For this reason, we've seen a rise in conspiracy theories and boycotting of practices that keep us safe from things such as diseases, pollution, and climate change. Skepticism has been replaced with outright denial and the inability to change opinions based on newly available facts.
Even though this book is 55 years old, it's shockingly relevant as to how we got here with the trends recognized in the 60's in evangelism and business activism being more relevant today than back then.

How is this new definition helpful? Seems to just burn a lot of bridges.","the purpose of power + prejudice was to move discourse away from the idea of being racist as a personal failing, and instead focus on structural oppression and the material reality of minority groups. 
Basically liberal society largely seems to have conceived racism as 'being irrartionally mean', but for people with a materialist anti-racist perspective, that definition isn't productive or insightful and the lack of material, tangible progress for black people post-civil rights made it clear that there needed to be more focus on power dynamics and historical context to combat racism.

I'm not sure I'll be able to express my thoughts here but I'll try. I found feminism (more like power feminism) in my childhood and promised myself I'd change the world by getting top marks in university and investing everything in a career and then hiring women one day. (lol)
Over the years my power feminism delusion was shattered as I got into my male-dominated field and suffered from harassment, touching, bullying, patronising, male workers being promoted and paid more despite doing less work than me, being left out of the boys club, despite me also being interested in stereotypically male interests so the only difference is physical. Men being considered geniuses just for existing. When talking about issues I've suffered I'm asked if I'm making things up or being overly sensitive.
My field (tech) has men regularly wondering aloud if women are biologically capable of tech, or if we should even help them into the field in the first place. 
It has also been slowly driving me mentally insane that the men who are the most misogynistic and incapable of interacting with, or seeing women as human beings are the most likely to be given leadership positions and lauded for their intellect. (my idea of intelligence obviously does not match the workplace's idea of intelligence)
So as we know, meritocracy does not exist. Anyone who isn't a healthy-bodied white, male will have to shoulder and bear so much more bullshit and stress just to get ahead in the workplace. And when it comes to subconscious bias, you can't fight an invisible enemy.
I've just been continuing along in rage at the state of the tech industry. Here are the choices that I have:
1. Work 10x harder than the men around me to get ahead, and in doing so rewarding my bosses with extra profits, and rewarding them for them creating an unfair culture in their workplace that I have to disproportionately shoulder.
2. Change to a non-male-dominated field and earn lower wages. I'm from a very poor background this means I would be closing myself off to options and freedom in my life. I don't want to go back because I can see in my extended family what a lifetime lack of money means, and i remember what it was like until I got my first 'real' job. It can be stressful and sometimes terrifying to not have a financial backup.
3. Instead of feeling disrespect toward the culture of the workplace, I become a little more delusional and accept it and support it fully. Blend in, care deeply about company profits, invest optimistically in my skills and spend less and less time reading books on the ""imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"" that exists everywhere in the world. Believe in meritocracy and that if I was good enough I'd get ahead. Basically unsee everything that i see right now.

How do you survive 30+ years in the working world, while knowing what you know, without going insane? I think the more you read about the state of the world, the less likely you're able to deal with the repeated, immature, small-minded, backwards politics of the workplace.","Have you considered calling them on their bullshit? I’m in the army so it’s virtually impossible for me to lose my job, so this might not be an option for you. But when men speak over me I interrupt them and tell them thats not okay. When they ask whether women should be there I point major errors they’ve made, or I point out the holes in their logic depending on the scenario. It’s got its own drawbacks, in that I’m going to war every time I run into an asshole, and the real trash can humans will never change, but some of the more Center people who just couldn’t see what they were doing over their privilege have changed.
I’m actually at a crossroads right now. I know that this will stagnate my career at times when I have a largely male, trash can chain of command because I’m not brown nosing and giggling the way they want (and they do expect the brown nosing from men as well) but I think I’m happy being where I am forever as long as my ethics are in tact.",43,0,0,0

Mind-blowing as the theories are, there's always that uneasy feeling of doubt: What if the theories are all guessworks? How are their validity assessed? How are they used and how are they relevant to the real world? 
When he was Chairman of the Social Science Research Council in Britain, Andrew Schonfield wrote:
>""In the social sciences it is rarely possible to pose questions and provide answers in the manner of some of the natural sciences, and it is a refusal to recognize this that has often led us up the wrong path. It is the nature of most of our work that it tends to produce useful ideas and an increasingly firm factual base, rather than clear-cut answers to major policy questions. We must try to tease out the relationships which have a crucial effect on policy and, in doing so, provide not so much widely applicable generalizations as a sound, informed basis for decision-making and, at the same time, cut down the area of reliance on guesswork and prejudice."" (Schonfield, 1971).
I wholeheartedly agree with this quote, but can't seem to find the ""increasingly firm factual base"" for the theories that I'm interested in. For example, do we have any ways to verify Foucault's claims of how power works, or Judith Butler's claims of the existence of many genders, apart from just following the reasoning in their books? What are their contributions to practice-oriented research, apart from providing a possible interpretation of the social phenomena in question? Does policy-making ultimately rely on factual findings, rather than the theories?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

But is there anyway to objectively measure this?
There are measurements of inequality in a society like economic inequality and gender inequality. [The GINI coefficient works by measurement how often high incomes and low incomes occur at certain frequencies of the population.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) The [Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii) measures the inequality of women in a society by measures of reproductive health, political and occupational empowerment, and economic status.

But how would you measure how common racial prejudice is in a given country or society. [BuisinessTech used a poll](https://businesstech.co.za/news/lifestyle/116644/the-most-racist-countries-in-the-world/) by seeing how each country responds to having people of another race as neighbors. This seems flawed though because there is more to racism than just living next to each other and countries have vastly different demographics and definition of race; not to mention potential response bias at play. [You could just observe how many ethnic conflicts/wars and race riots a particular country has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_riots) and presume that it must be a very racist or non-racist country based on that. But again, there could be more reasons for lack of riots than just good race relations like homogeneity or an authoritarian dictatorship. I think the most comprehensive tool available might be the Implicit Association Test done in [America](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/) and [Europe.](https://mindhacks.com/2017/05/03/this-map-shows-what-white-europeans-associate-with-race-and-it-makes-for-uncomfortable-reading/) Unfortunately the studies seem to be focused on Anti-Black racism rather than racism in general.

I think the biggest problem with an index for racism is the different ethnic demographics different countries have. There are plenty of countries that are over 98% one ethnic group and many of the people who live there will never encounter a person of another ethnicity in their entire life. In a homogeneous country like that, the general population might not understand race or ethnic relations the way far more diverse countries do so polling them about race would lead to strange results.

Is there a global or international index that measures racial discrimination in a given jurisdiction or nation-state?

To begin, I work in the field of criminal justice and conduct research related to the intersection between crime and gender. There are a number of activists of every persuasion on social media who represent criminological research poorly.
To get a few assumptions out of the way:
I am a white man. As a result of this, I already:
(1) Listen to women and racial minorities when they speak.
(2) Do not invalidate the lived experiences of others, though I do often find that my own experiences with poverty, trauma, and mental, physical, and sexual abuse are invalidated on a regular basis.
(3) Do not involve myself in debates of racism online unless to reject racism or prejudice in conversations I have started myself, because my opinion is elsewise of little value and I don't know what it's like to be non-white.
(4) Do not respond to threads by women on women's issues in conflict with their perspective, because to do so is rarely productive, and I am well-informed from previous posts that this conduct that I have never engaged in to begin with is improper. I don't come into threads women start asserting my need to be empirically correct, I don't question the validity of their experiences. I generally just avoid engaging entirely unless to share in agreement.
With these out of the way, misinformation when promoted by anyone of any ideology has a direct impact on my field of study. It makes communicating criminological and crime truths more difficult and obfuscates the causes and consequences of numerous sociopolitical social structures, functions, forms, paradigms, and interactions. If I see activists propagating untrue information, what is the best course of action in countering such misinformation?","Representing just myself here, but I like it when the person I’m talking to shows a genuine interest in an area of research.

I realise that this may have been a pretty disreputable bunch who conducted the survey and that they were trying probably deliberately trying to exploit bias to obtain the results they wanted, which itself wouldn't be an issue for someone who was honestly trying to write a good survey. But it occurred to me that even when not trying to find and use such an exploit it could still slip through the cracks. I don't even know if there's a name for this bias.

Demographic Majority - The ethnic group that makes up over 51% of the region or state or country or jurisdiction's population. Generally the demographic majority forms the basic framework of the society when it comes to culture or economics or other areas. All nation-states are countries with a demographic majority.
Voluntary Minorities - These are ethnic minorities that willingly came to another country or area and went through an official immigration process. There are generally filters in place to both make sure the immigrant is a good fit for the country and only a certain type of person would be willing to leave their homeland and desire to become an ethnic minority somewhere else. Voluntary minorities are often model minorities and generally exhibit the [immigrant paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_paradox) where first generation immigrants outperform the native born population when it comes to health, education, low crime, etc.
Involuntary Minorities - These are ethnic minorities that were forced to become part of the country they currently inhabit. This could either be due to the fact that they were militarily conquered, they were forcefully migrated, or they were enslaved and brought to the nation. Involuntary minorities tend to be opposed to the dominant culture due to past resentment and stigmatization of their native culture and language/dialect and behaviors. This leads to involuntary minorities having far lower income and educational attainment than other groups. In the USA, involuntary minorities who are seen as being too assimilated into the dominant ethnicity are disparaged as ""acting White"". A good example of an involuntary minority would be Aboriginal Australians.
Refugees - Refugees are people who come to a country not because they wanted to join the nation-state but because they had to leave their home nation for safety. This could be either be due to active warfare and violence in their country or origin or religious, ethnic, or economic persecution. Refugees generally try to seek asylum in the nearest safe country that will take them. Refugees often return to their country of origin if it becomes safe again. If refugees do not decide to return to their country of origin, they generally exist as a non-integrated underclass. A good example of a refugee group would be Syrians in Turkey.
Elite (or Dominant) Minorities - These are ethnic groups that have massive amounts of political, socioeconomic, and cultural control in a country despite the fact that they are a minority. A classic example are White South Africans during the apartheid days. Elite minorities are extremely over-represented and almost exclusively reside in the upper echelons of society. Dominant minorities should be not confused with model minorities.
Model Minorities - A model minority ethnic group is an ethnicity that is perceived as being more educationally or occupationally or behaviorally successful than the typical person in the country. A good example of model minorities would be Indian Americans in the USA. The difference between an model minority and a dominant minority is that the demographic majority still has most of the political and economic control in a society with model minorities, but that is not the case with dominant or elite minorities. A model minority might also still face structural or institutional prejudice and discrimination in their country despite their socioeconomic success while a dominant minority cannot face institutional racism because they control the institutions.
Underclass Minorities - Just like how model minorities are more successful than the socioeconomic average of a country, underclass minorities are less successful than the socioeconomic average of a country. This could be due to a variety of factors.
Subservient Majority - This is the inverse of a dominant minority. This is a demographic majority that does not have representative political and economic influence in their country due to being ruled by a dominant minority.

There are a lot of studies comparing the statistical outcomes and opinions and behaviors of African-Americans compared to Asian-Americans or Mexican-Americans or White-Americans  but I do not think that is a good comparison due to the vastly different history African-Americans have to those other groups. I think African-Americans would be most comparable other involuntary minorities within the USA like Native Americans and Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans and Puerto Ricans and Samoans and Guamanians, etc.

are there any research or thesis papers that covers the assimilation or segregation of various involuntary minorities or even just indigenous groups in several countries like Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Russia for instance?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Few days ago I just gave up trying to fully recover my hard drive after weeks of attempt, including from professional. I should've backed my data up immediately after fieldwork, but due to certain circumstances, I didn't.
Anyway, I've been trying to move on for the past few days, hence this thread.
There's no way I can re-experience the fieldwork. However there are some bits and pieces of interviews and notes that I managed to salvage. 
Is it methodologically sound if I write based on assembling those limited pieces of data and recollection from my own memory? I know many details will be lost, and I can't reproduce the exact words or situation. I'm worried that my recalling of the events may speak a lot of my bias instead of presenting the subjects as they are.

First time posting here, and I hope it isn't a repeat (I tried searching for a similar question, but couldn't find one). 
Can systematic racism occur in countries or areas where white people are considered a minority, in executive roles as well as in the general population?
Honestly curious about this, since I was taught in my sociology class in college that **prejudice** is harboring an unfavorable generalization about a particular race/ethnic group, **racism** is acting on that prejudice to the detriment of someone from that race or ethnic group (sometimes with power, sometimes without, depending on who you are talking to), and **institutional racism** (structural racism) is racism built into laws of infrastructure using power from those who are prejudiced. 
This leads me to the question: Sociologically, can racism and institutional racism be perpetrated against a white person in either a sub-section of the United States, or in a foreign country?

However, I've gotten some comments throughout my life that I'm pretty sure are sexist, but that don't fit the dictionary definition:
- ""I wouldn't rape you, because you're too ugly.""
- ""You should shave.""
- ""Can I piss in your mouth?""
- ""Do you shave down there?""
- When I and some other girls tried to discuss something, we were referred to as ""hens"" that ""cackled""
- A lot of comments in general about what they think about how I look (from guys I know, and don't know very well):""I don't understand why people say you're pretty, I don't find you attractive"", ""you're starting to get a little fat around the thighs"", ""you look prettier when you smile""

And in shame-honor-based cultures (like Japan), what prevents people from doing something wrong is how others, or society in general, will view them.  And that people will commonly do things that are wrong as long as they are very sure they won't get caught.  I would never cheat on a test, because I would feel very guilty...regardless if I get caught or not.  But in a shame culture, people won't feel any guilt for cheating at all, as long as they're careful. Correct me if I'm wrong!
To my Western mind, it seems to me that guilt cultures are more sincere, more true, and that shame cultures are shallow, caring only about appearances.  But this is probably cultural bias!  So I'm wondering how do shame cultures feel about the fact they're shame cultures?  Do they find the whole thing insincere and/or out-dated, or do they think it's better than guilt cultures?

So far, they’ve been totally accepting of me and my feminist beliefs and agree with me for the most part. However, there is one member of the friend group whose views I find problematic.
He hates nearly all female-centred media (Ocean’s Eight, Ghostbusters, the new Doctor Who are examples he’s mentioned.) However, he states his reasoning for not liking these media are the writing, the actors etc. He says that none of the actors are compelling and they are dull. His latest critique is with the new Captain Marvel. He took issue with Brie Larson’s comments about white males and stated that she doesn’t embody the role (he hasn’t seen the movie yet.) He says her attitude to the movie is wrong and he called her dull and monotone. He’s made me feel bad for liking these forms of media. He sends me images of Doctor Who’s low score on Rotten Tomatos and he’s even hacked Rotten Tomatos to make Captain Marvel look like it got a low audience score in order to trick me into thinking it was bad.
I know that these issues are minor compared to other major issues concerning gender equality. Even my friends say that he’s got a bias against female leads. They’ve tried before to change his mind. I have no problem with people not liking these movies. For ages, I thought that he just disliked those movies because he just thought they were bad. But now that I notice the pattern in female-centric movies, it makes me feel kind of uncomfortable and insecure in the group. Perhaps I’m being overly sensitive.
I know I shouldn’t make it such a big deal. I’m not saying that he’s a sexist, but I definitely think that he might have an unconscious bias against women. The issue is that I really like my friends and they’ve helped me through some tough times. I’m afraid of bringing it up because I don’t want to distinguish my status any further as the only girl in the group. I don’t want to feel like the other. Hanging out with this guy is kind of part of the deal with this group of friends, so what should I do?","I've been in similar situations before with friends, the thing that's helped me work through it is to stop trying to discuss the actual issue causing the disagreement, and to instead talk with them about the way that the issue made me feel. So for example, I have a friend who used to make a lot of homophobic jokes and it made me very uncomfortable, anytime I tried to tell her that the things she was saying were homophobic I'd be met with things like ""I don't really see how it's homophobic though,"" ""Who cares if it's homophobic, it's still funny,"" or ""Yeah but clearly *I'm* not homophobic, I'm friends with you and you're gay,"" trying to argue about the topic itself was unproductive and only escalated things; what helped was to not argue about homophobia or the joke itself, but to just explain how the jokes made me feel, after I told her that those sorts of jokes made me uncomfortable and reminded me of other hurtful things I'd heard in the past and that it was difficult to hear those things from a friend, she was able to start understanding my side of things better and stopped making homophobic jokes (almost overnight tbh.)

Sometimes it's just not possible to get someone to agree with you on an issue, especially if it's something they're set in their ways about, but if you can make that issue more personal to them by talking about how the issue is important to you and how it makes you feel, you can help them open up their mind a bit more to change. Maybe instead of talking to him about whether or not he's being sexist, just try telling him that the way he talks sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable and insecure; if he values you as a friend then he should care about whether or not you're comfortable and he might make a bit more of an effort to change, and if he doesn't seem to care about your comfort then he's probably not much of a friend and nothing of value will be lost if you have to stop talking with him lol.",26,1,1,1

Rape fantasies are one of the most common sexual fantasies in women and men and yet the people who engage in rape fantasies are not rapists and do not want to rape anyone or be raped. 
People have tried to portray the BDSM community as pathological for years and research has shown time and time again that it's not. Domination/Submission fantasies have taken on almost every role imaginable within the BDSM community, ageplay, sex slavery, boss/employee, teacher/student, and even owner/pet play. All of these fetishes exist within the BDSM community and yet there is no compelling evidence that any of them demonstrate an actual desire by those involved to do something terrible to a person/animal in real life. It seems to be simply the case that people are creative when trying to invent D/s fantasies that they can role play. 
So, while I am sure some people are worried I genuinely see no reason to single out ageplay and assume for some reason that the practioners of this one D/s fantasy must be different than all of the other flavors of D/s fantasies that play out elsewhere. 
In addition, let's assume your point is valid. Let's say that all the people who engage in age-play are pedophiles. They  find an adult partner, have a normal adult relationship and sometimes they role play out the fantasy. Who is being harmed by that? No one. The pedophile is dealing with their sexual attraction in a way that ensures no one gets hurt and in a way that allows them to live a normal, functioning life. 
I truly don't believe that any significant portion of the BDSM community are pedophiles. But even if they were, I would see this as a healthy and productive way to deal with a sexual attraction that they know they can never act on. Most pedophiles are non-offending, and many of the people who abuse children are not pedophiles, they're just opportunists.",27,0,0,0

I have noticed a trend in research articles for researchers to just accept what participants say, as they say it. This is not to say that all people are lying, but some might even be lying to themselves perhaps. 
Outside of research as far as I can tell, there is a narrative in middle-class circles and the upwardly socially mobile of denigrating the working-classes as deserving their ""lower"" place due to them *being* lower, having less merit- the meritocratic narrative plus chauvinism we might call it. Conversely, working-class people often subscribe to a narrative of resentment in which middle-class people are put down as ""snobs"" and ""toffs"", which they might also often believe but also probably covers feelings of resentment, a kind of Freudian defense mechanism. 
While these narratives seem to have some research about them, it seems that the effect of these beliefs and how they might influence the performance of research participants in interviews doesn't seem to have been discussed much- or at least, I'm struggling to find anything about it. I'm an independent scholar currently so rarely have proper access to journals and decent library resources or guides that can help me improve my searches. 
I hypothesize that some interviewees may hide feelings of resentment, or superiority, from interviewers due to wanting to please them and enjoying the attention of being part of social research. For example, in some research about social mobility where participants claim that ""moving up in the world"" ""hasn't changed them"", that although they have been upwardly socially mobile, they retain their original social identity. I think it's possible that some of these interviewees may downplay how they have changed and when discussing why they think they have moved up in the world, narratives about hard work may hide deeper feelings of superiority. Similarly, would working-class participants be less willing to be so brazen as to call middle-class people ""toffs"" and decry social mobility as bullshit, when it is very likely that the interviewer would be middle-class? How do biases such as ""just world bias"" effect people's reasoning about social mobility and the justness of theirs or others social position? Is there much research into these things? 
Sorry if this isn't a very clear question, it came to me while doing other research.","So my background is sociolinguistics/linguistic anthropology, but because it intersects with economies of class and hegemony, especially in terms of narrative and communication, there are a couple I can think of off the top of my head that deal with class perpetuation and interview/interviewee dissonance.

These fields haven't always been very self-reflexive about the effect of the Observer Paradox, but I think the literature is moving in a direction that tries to look at these narratives from several different perspectives to get a more nuanced understanding of meaning-making and language use coupled with ideas about social value and social mobility.
Again, I'm sorry my suggestions are pretty deeply entrenched in a few fields, but hopefully this is a good start. I hope your research bears the fruit you're looking for!",2,1,1,1

Is there a direct link between Hollywood’s portrayal of Indigenous peoples and the inequalities that Indigenous communities face today?",">How does Hollywood’s depiction of Indigenous peoples affect prejudice and discrimination towards them, according to contact theory ?
[Intergroup contact theory](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f3f1/e3d7044f2ca8a6e56a3dc51f556945eb3dd1.pdf) *by itself* is about how prejudice decreases via contact, which requires some sort of interaction. It is reasonable to take into consideration how preexisting attitudes, beliefs and ideologies interact with intergroup contact, but this requires deploying other theories and approaches such as [social identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_identity_approach) and [social representation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_representation)
As Pettigrew explains:
>Both individual differences and societal norms shape intergroup contact effects. The deeply prejudiced both avoid intergroup contact and resist positive effects from it. Societies suffering intergroup conflict both restrict and under-cut intergroup contact. 
For example, [this study took into account both intergroup contact and the ideological climate](https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_667D3F70C541.P001/REF.pdf) (""[b]ased on a social representations approach, we argued that the ideological climate is made up by shared normative stances that implicitly or explicitly guide reactions towards immigration"") and found the importance of considering the latter, too.
Thus, to evaluate the effects of Hollywood's depiction of Indigenous Americans on prejudice and discrimination, I would actually apply other theories about intergroup conflict, stereotypes and the such, as intergroup contact is not appropriate for the question.

> Is there a direct link between Hollywood’s portrayal of Indigenous peoples and the inequalities that Indigenous communities face today?
Generally speaking, when evaluating the effects of things such as mass media and entertainment, it is never a *direct* effect on prejudice and/or discrimination. The more direct effects are the emotional, cognitive and behavioral processes which can be affected by depictions of given social groups and which (depending on several factors) lead to emotional, cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
---
That said, what is the role played by the portrayal of Indigenous Americans?
To begin with, [can media have an effect on, say, racial/ethnic stereotypes?](https://books.google.ch/books?id=oC7eRTMmo3YC&hl=de&source=gbs_book_similarbooks) Citing Mastro:
>**Given the discrepancies in portrayals of different racial/ethnic groups in the media and the varying usage patterns** associated with different races/ethnicities, it should come as no surprise that **a variety of race-based effects have been linked with exposure**. Indeed, these **studies indicate that when it comes to effects of media exposure on majority as well as minority group members, the quality of content is critical.** Although this may appear to be an oversimplification of a complex relationship, in essence it reflects the core findings in this area.
Citing Roskos-Ewoldsen and colleagues from the same book:
>As in the other domains, research in the stereotype domain indicates that the **media can prime stereotypes and that these primed stereotypes influence how people are perceived.** The research on media priming of stereotypes increases our confidence in the generality of the media as a prime because this research provides validation that **the media can act as a prime in a unique research domain, and that a variety of media (e.g., advertisements, rock music videos, newsletters) can act as primes.**
What about depictions of Native Americans specifically? I am not aware of much research in this *specific* domain. As Mastro observed, the answer would depend on how they are portrayed. 
Their [depiction has arguably evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrayal_of_Native_Americans_in_film), such that in the past they were used as uncivilized villains to quote Wikipedia. Such depictions would not be accepted as is today (which requires me to highlight the fact that the relationship between media and society is not unidirectional, the former also conveys attitudes and stereotypes coming from society itself).
According to this [old survey of Native Americans](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/106461798246943):
>**Most of the respondents were not satisfied with television programming**. Although they watch a variety of television programs,   **only a handful of   the shows include Native Americans in their stories** […]
>The results of   this  project suggest that, **although television might provide negative and inaccurate portrayals, films tend to be more realistic and positive.**
But these results should be taken with judicious caution. The sample consisted of ""190 self-identified Native American students enrolled in a Northwestern U.S.    college during January 1995"" and only 34% replied (74 respondents). This might have been a particular group of Native Americans (for example, these are students and do not include Indigenous Americans living in reservations).
I would note that still today there are criticisms towards how this social group is depicted in popular culture and how they are represented. Citing this [article by the National Geographic:](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/12/native-americans-recasting-views-indigenous-life/)
>Even so, **most of today’s narratives about indigenous Americans are cast through a negative lens, focusing on health disparities, economic disadvantages, poverty, or addiction, according to the First Nations Development Institute**, a nonprofit that seeks to improve the economies of native communities.
In sum, I cannot cite a study or multiple studies to give a concrete answer. Yes, portrayals of minorities can interact with peoples' attitudes, beliefs, ideologies and contribute to prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. Do movies play a significant role? I cannot say, it depends on how Hollywood depicts Native Americans. I would tend to agree with Nat Geo and expect that Hollywood does not contribute positively to the their image, but I might be wrong: there needs to be more research concerning this specific group.",1,0,0,0

This book had a flashy style like all the books for kids, with lots of graphics and images among the activities. For the school i get it, you get 30 or even 40 kids in a tight room, you could use some sort of visual catch to make the kids pay attention to the book and it's more didactic.
What leads me to ask this question is the following:
Some days ago i was helping my cousin who's a high school student with her homework, and i realized that she uses the same style of schoolbooks that i used, obviously the level of the content is something else, much higher than a school book... but nonetheless the books all had a very basic style, with stylized graphics and images just like the school-level books. 
It bothers me because i feel like while the books touch on the subjects, it has no depth on the content that the student is reading.
In example, i was explaining the laws of newton to my cousin and used some examples from recreative physics, a book from a 1913's Russian author that touches on physics without calculations and all of that. One story was about what would happen if the earth was to suddenly stop and the destructive winds and whatever. 
All this write up comes to this: I've talked to lots of people and they all agree that new books have less ""value"" than old books, (unless it's university-level text but even in some cases with hard science there's basically no change bethween a 1970's edition and a 2018 edition) but i'm no one to claim that.
Whenever i say that ""old"" books carry more content or that they are worse/better, maybe that's just how i look from my scope at this point in life. It's a easy to me to say that this or that is better or worse but it's the kids or the younger generation that take this content in their journey in education. Maybe everyone that i've talked to says that they agree with me because they romanticize their childhood and how they lived it.  
My guess is that those books are edited by people that are more intelligent than me, and they studied pedagogy and know what they are doing, but sometimes what happens behind the courtain isn't exactly what it looks like at first. In example, university textbooks that are expensive for no reason than because they are required. 
The reason why i can't shake this feeling is because something is actually changing about education in ways that i cannot percieve but hold on for a moment, i'd rather ask here and see if anyone can give me an answer instead of carrying on with an opinion that may be wrong as the result of a bias of mine. 
So to sum it up, is there any evidence that changing the way that the content is delivered to the student speaking strictly about high school level textbooks leads to more engagement or a better understanding of the subject by the students?",N/A,N/A,1,1,1

1. Do women notice the attractiveness but keep it to themselves and not base their decision on appearance?
2. Are women less likely than men to even appraise attractiveness in their minds in the first place?
3. Does the appearance bias happen both ways but since men are generally in the positions to make the decisions, it negatively affects women more so. E.g. if male applicants to a nursing position were being interviewed by women, would the applicant's appearance play a role?
4. Anything else I'm missing?","Yes. So studies were done with resumes, identical, except for change of name, and attached photos. The more attractive the female was, the more likely the hiring individual I would think that the resume didn't have enough experience etc. The less attractive the female was, they would rate the person more Like they would if they were male.
While men they found little correlation between the attractiveness of the male photo attached and how they rated the experience of the person whose resume they reviewed. 
This was the same for both male and female hirers/managers looking at the resume.
Edit: so the bias is both ways for male and females except for both males and females it is negatively on attractive females.",21,0,0,0

Hi! This is my first post and sorry if similar topics have been answered before - I opted for a new post so I can capture the details. I'm really just wondering on what people think about this since it has really stuck with me and I've been reflecting a lot as a result:
**Context**  
Before the pandemic, I was seeing a girl I met at University (a few months and it didn't work out but it ended amicably). One of the days we were hanging out at my place with three of my housemates (female) and they frequently commented on things like the male character in a film (The Quiet Place - I recommend it, btw!) being useless and stupid because he's a man, and me not understanding why he's useless because I'm also man, etc. Since this is a Reddit post, I don't want to paint them in a bad light: I could tell they didn't mean anything negative by it and it seemed like they were kind of having a good time and bouncing off each other. Similar things happened frequently with this girl during the time we were seeing each other, but to the point.
Later that night, she asked what was bothering me since she could tell something was on my mind (I was taking longer than usual to fall asleep). I explained that I felt a bit weird and didn't really like when she/my housemates would often make negative remarks about me or my other housemate (the other guy in the house) and attribute when we messed up (less jokey examples) to being male. We had a messy argument about it which we resolved over the course of a few hours. The next morning I felt uncomfortable about it so we talked some more and were both put at ease.
**My Questions**  
What I'm asking about are the things she said that really stuck with me:
I said (approx) that I can only sympathize with the effects of sexism against women (she said that I didn't understand because I'm a man) but that I'm only responsible for myself / not how other men act and have acted in the past.  
She said (approx) that I need to take responsibility and that I don't get to complain about those kinds of comments since the oppression of women now (and historically) is so much worse.
I said something like how I would completely accept something like that if it were because of something I was responsible for and could appreciate the motivation but that it didn't make sense to me as to why they should be directed at me if I try my best to be better (and would call myself a feminist / act against sexism). She said that it might not be rational but that I should just trust that she knows that it's the case and that I was being a 'not-all-men bitch'.
Obviously I am writing this and it's reliant on my memory but I've done my best to give a fair account of what actually happened rather than being butt-hurt because she called me a bitch, lol.
Apologies that this is a long ping-pong of a post but I figured that asking here might be a good idea since maybe this has flagged up something in myself (like an implicit bias or way of thinking) that I need to identify and work on. **My questions are essentially just whether this way of thinking is something I should try to avoid (even if it doesn't make sense to me) or that my behavior is the kind of thing that contributes to sexism and works against feminist progress.**

>Source from the Department of Justice, look at table 12. The number of White violent offenders in 2018 was 2,669,900, White people were 62.3% of the population. The number of Black violent offenders was 1,155,670, Black people were 12% of the population. If Black people are that much overrepresented as violent offenders based on data from the survey of victims of crimes (data from the FBI also shows vast overrepresentation), then how is it racist for the police to be more likely to kill (justifiably or not) Black suspects?
Another post: 
>Police killings in the USA for 2018:
>White: 451 killed / 5.3M arrests = .008%
>Black: 229 killed / 2.1M arrests = .011%
>Hispanic: 165 killed / 1.2M arrests = .014%
>Black people are about 10 percent more likely to be killed during an arrest than the average. Perhaps that needs improvement, but it hardly constitutes a crisis in and of itself. The bigger problem is that black people are twice as likely to get arrested.
A third:
>Blacks are 2.5 times more likely to die from police because they disproportionately commit more violent crimes. FBI crime statistics from 2017 show that blacks committed 37.5% of violent crimes. Blacks make up 13.4% of the population, yet they are 2.79 times more likely to commit a violent crime. Hispanic/Latino individuals make up 18.3% of the population and commit 23.5% of violent crimes, so they are 1.28 times more likely to commit a violent crime.
**All the statistics in these comments appear to be accurate, but I believe I am missing something.** I have no doubt that the conditions of poverty and the legacies of systemic racism contribute to the contemporary behavior of some boys and men within the black community (media stereotypes, broken homes, poor education/nutrition, alienated families, low-income housing, etc.). **Nor do I believe that there is any genetic basis for any of these circumstances.** I'm sure it's all socialization.

I think fat shaming seems to be the most prevalent form of this, but I see it manifest in other ways as well. 
I've been told that this isn't a feminist issue and told by some others to take a sort of apathetical approach to it, but that doesn't feel right to do, I guess?? 
Minus the discussions about what causes obesity and what we as a society can do to prevent and treat it, why does this particular topic always devolve into a hostile, bullying free-for-all? People that are overweight or obese are still deserving of some basic level of respect and dignity as human beings, but it's both baffling and disheartening to see so many people dismiss that aspect of the issue.
A few years ago, I had a major injury which prevented me from being as active as I normally am and as a result, I got fairly chubby. It was awful to experience first-hand that sort of bias that so many people have towards bigger bodies. As I recovered, I became more active again and eventually lost the weight, but I quickly noticed the way people were treating me better! My best friend also happens to be obese, and I know she's dealt with discrimination and harassment because of her size. I'm very close to her, so the thought of others treating her like that infuriates me.
I feel like some people just think that an overweight or obese person existing is 'GlOrIfYiNg ObEsItY' and take the opportunity to launch into a stream of reasons as to why that person is unhealthy and why they don't have to respect them because of their size.
I know that the origin of fatphobia comes from a deeply racist and misogynistic history. So why do so many feminists ignore, or contribute to the bullying when there is a bigger push for the movement to be intersectional?","Because being a feminist doesn't stop you being prejudice or bias in other ways - same way we have racism in the LGBTQ+ community, ableism in anti-racism communities, etc.

Stotland believes the topic is more complex than the responses given by universities and colleges today. It gives anecdotal evidence from both men and women and their experiences with Title IX told by Stotland. In one example an accused male student was expelled when both him and the accuser agreed that they consented the only split was that the accuser mentioned that they had faked the orgasm to get out of the room more gracefully. The accused in this situation was found responsible and suspended for 2 years. Stotland admits this is an extreme case but states that she has realized in this issue than “Yes” does not always mean “Yes” and that consent is not always simple or clear cut and that we should teach young people how to navigate confusing moments rather than insist things are all black and white. 
 Stotland makes a possible controversial point where she states that many a time, society wants to place a liar and a truth teller in the topic of a campus sexual assault report, however this is not always correct. She believes that at times both sides are truthfully reporting their bias externally influenced often drunken memories of a night. Which points to the an overall statement that there is not always an absolute truth or absolute wrong in these complex topics. Which calls for a better response to deal with this issue on campus.
Another example Stotland uses is an example where one of her students was accused of assault where both sides admitted to consent at first. However the accuser began to cry during the sex. The accuser says that the accused did not stop immediately when this happened but the accused student stated that he stopped immediately once he noticed the accuser was crying. Stotland asserts that neither student is lying, further she states that we shouldn’t fram every disagreement as a disagreement between a truth teller and a liar.
Stotland also gives a third example between two woman who during freshman year got drunk and had a sexual encounter with a male student. Both of those women felt that they were sexually assaulted by the male student however only one of those students reported the incident to the university. During the course of the investigation Stotland says that the one who had reported it began to feel as though the other woman was also at fault. The woman who had not reported the sexual assault became the accused and was also found responsible and suspended for 3 1/2 years for an incident which she feels she was raped. Stotland believes that when the narrative is black and white that victims can become “perpetrators”.
Stotland then goes on to mention that in these cases and in the majority of her other cases there is one element they all have in common. Alcohol. Stotland talks about how we as a society don’t want to talk about the roles of alcohol abuse because we rightly don’t want to blame victims. However Stotland differs in thinking after that point, she thinks that addressing alcohol abuse on campuses would prevent students from becoming “perpetrators”. Scotland culminates her opinions by stating that if the mission is to end sexual assault we must lean into the “gray zone” not try to erase it. 
She concludes by saying this 
-let’s stop equating a good time in college with getting wasted all the time
-let’s create specific names for specific actions
-let’s teach the nuances o consent and good communication 
-And most importantly let’s treat sexual assault on campus like a Public Health issue. That means preventing not just punishing.

This is **not** comparable to how the Chinese were treated and how the [Irish were *indentured servants*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/us/irish-slaves-myth.html) . Also, the Confederate Constitution *specifically* singles out African Negroes as slaves, not Irish people. Also, neither country was ravaged as heavily as African countries by European people.
  In any case, after literal *lifetimes* of slavery, Black folks were hit very harshly with Jim Crow Laws which didn't end until the 1950s. [The origins of gangs with African Americans actually started because they had to defend themselves from racists while also trying to make a dollar.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/gangcolor/madness.htm). 
""A final factor encouraging gang formation was the Chicago race riot of 1919, in which gangs of white youth terrorized the black community, and in response black youth formed groups for self-protection.[60]""
Another quote 
""Racial anti-black violence on the part of white youths directly contributed to black youths forming self-protection societies that transformed into black gangs by the late 1960s.[61]""

- Also, according to Yale's *Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police*, while the police shoot and murder Black and White folks at roughly the same rate controlled for different factors, they also found that Black and Hispanic folks are 50% more likely to be subject to some force when being arrested. The study suggests that when controlled for contextual and behavioral factors, the number is reduced but still doesn't explain racial disparities. [This has the same Abstract section.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399) Furthermore, Yale concluded that while being compliant (and no arrest has been made), black people are 21.3% more likely to be subject to force.

- Black people are more likely to have their cars searched (and less likely to be explained a reason why). A Rhode Island study also showed they were likely to be stopped *and* somehow less likely to receive a citation. To me, this suggests that they were effectively stopped for no reason. A study in New York City showed that blacks were more likely than whites or nonblack minorities to be in jail while they await trial, even after controlling for the seriousness of charges and prior record. Black people are also 13% more likely to receive a plea deal that included longer jail time, again controlling for factors such as prior record. Researchers found that North Carolina prosecutors were excluding black people from juries in capital cases at twice the rate of other jurors, even when controlling for legitimate justifications for striking jurors, such as employment status or reservations about the death penalty. Black convicts have their probation revoked more often than whites and other minorities, according to a study of probation outcomes in Iowa, New York, Oregon, and Texas. These racial disparities held even when the study controlled for other characteristics of the probationers, such as their age, crime severity, and criminal history.

 >Despite only accounting for 13% of the population, blacks commit 56% of crime.
The claim that black people “commit X% of crime in America while only accounting for 12% of the US population” fails to take into account the effect of poverty on criminal behavior. Crime rates follow poverty trends *much* closer than they do race.
The Kaiser Family Foundation has provided [this chart](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) based on data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, 2008-2017. There are about 14.5 million white people and 7.8 million black people living in poverty in the US. If crime rate is driven by poverty rate, we can expect that black perpetrators will amount to about **53.8%** of the number of white perpetrators, accounting for about **35%** of all criminals who are either black or white.
[Here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43) is the FBI’s Crime in the US 2018 report by its Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which collects arrest data from over 12,000 agencies across the country. It is important to remember these figures represent arrests, not individuals (since one individual can be arrested multiple times) nor convictions. The is a huge obstacle when it comes to assessing who *commits* more crime, but it remains one of the only sources for crime data available. So let’s review:
Table 43A  
White arrests: 5,319,654  
Black arrests: 2,115,381  
Total B+W: 7,435,035
Based on these numbers alone, black arrests amount to way under half (39.8%) of white arrests, or 28% of the total B+W arrests.
However, the figure of white Americans in poverty from the KFF website excluded white hispanics, while the white arrests may or may not be Hispanic, so I will correct for that and attempt to find the number of non-Hispanic white arrests. The reporting of Hispanic arrests is incomplete because not all agencies report Hispanic ethnicity. 7,710,900 arrests are included under race, while only 6,343,684 arrests are either ‘Hispanic or Latino’ (1,191,334) or ‘Not Hispanic or Latino’ (5,152,350). If this proportion (18.8% Hispanic) hold true, then out of 7,710,900 arrests we can expect that around 1,449,649 were Hispanic (sig. figs. be damned)
Of these Hispanic arrests, how many were white? That’s tough to know. According to Page 6 in the [Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf) by the US Census Bureau, approximately 53% of Hispanic individuals are White Only. But let’s ignore that and assume for a moment that *all* 1,449,649 Hispanic arrests were white, and that not a single Hispanic individual was black or American Indian. That brings the number of non-Hispanic white arrests down to:
Non-Hispanic White arrests: 3,870,005  
Black arrests: 2,115,381  
Total: 5,985,386
Here, Black arrests are equal **54.6%** of the Non-Hispanic White arrests, **35.3%** of total arrests. Even with this *very generous* estimation of how many hispanics arrests were also white, we see that the arrest rate of black people as compared to white people is proportionate to their poverty rate.
Keep in mind the FBI is reporting arrests, not convictions. And police are already biased. So even with biased police officers, and even without using convictions as a standard for guilt, this is what we get. For comparison, here's a source that uses the reported race of the offender, rather than arrests:
Bureau of Justice Statistics: [Criminal Victimization, 2017](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv17.pdf)

*Nonfatal violent incidents, by total population, victim, and offender demographic characteristics, 2017*  
Offender:  
White: 49.2%  
Black: 24.5%  
Black offenders are **49.8%** of white offenders, **33.2%** of total offenders
This is further supported by previous BJS studies, such as:

I conduct research in the field of criminal justice focusing on the intersection of gender and crime. My primary interests are cyberstalking/harassment and intimate partner violence, but I have a secondary interest in sexual assault issues.
I have a few side questions here and I want to ""make my case,"" as it were. I consider myself an ally to feminist causes and try to keep feminist perspectives in mind when researching for and writing papers, so I hope that this is taken in good faith, as I write it as such.
**My primary focus:**
Today, I was reading a thread on one of my social media pages where a woman I am friends with posted that if a woman is drunk, she cannot consent to sex, *period*. As one might expect, women in the comments agreed and one man objected. This appears to be the common response; that women mostly agree and men mostly disagree.
In my opinion, it's more complicated an issue than we sometimes give it credit. On the one hand, it's probably wise not to drink and have sex with anyone who isn't our already-committed partner. If someone is heavily intoxicated and we are not, we should never sleep with them or touch them in a sexual manner.
**On the other hand, how do we determine fault if both parties were drunk, and where do we set the bar? That is to say, is** ***any*** **alcohol at all too much to consent, or is there a certain threshold? How do we determine whether either party was too drunk to consent if there is a threshold without their blood alcohol levels? If a woman begins by accusing a man of sexual assault because she was drunk, but he was likewise drunk and decides to accuse her back, how do we determine who was telling the truth? (I'm not sure temporal order is a sound choice considering it would set a bad precedent to assume the person who accuses first is the most honest, as a victim may have many legitimate reasons for hesitating to report an assault or crime.)**
I'm not talking about obvious cases where we have a woman so drunk she's unconscious and a man who hasn't had a drink is engaging in sexual acts with her while she's passed out, I mean ambiguous circumstances. If we are going to use broad, sweeping language to determine whether women can consent when intoxicated, we have to determine whether it applies to every scenario or only a few. If it's only a few or certain situations that the argument applies to, the argument that *drunk at all* means *cannot consent* becomes untenable. I don't think I am taking the position out of context when the argument is proposed as follows (quoting one of the people in the thread from my social media):  
>Even if someone was drinking they're under the influence. You can not legally get tattooed if you've been drinking because you can not properly consent. Sex is the same way. You cannot consciously consent to it.
The argument I usually see tends to begin with saying ""if she is drunk she can't consent,"" and then moves to ""blackout drunk"" when further justification is required. However, not all drinking or being drunk is ""blackout drunk."" Shifting terms in post-justification seems to me to be a reckless way to treat a serious and already-complex issue.
I think this is a real question we have to answer, not one we can hand-wave away. Beyond women's victimization, which is important, the answer of whether men can consent when drunk if women can't determines whether men who are sexually assaulted by women or other men are legitimized as victims. There is also the issue of determining guilt in cases where all we have to go on are peoples' word, which is not as easy as simply taking one side at face value and concluding the other party guilty (though, this is often what we do).
Sex isn't something done to women by men or vice versa, it's a mutual act (men ""fuck"" and women ""get fucked"" is language of patriarchal conditioning, I'd argue). So, if both parties are drunk at the same time, what happens, then? It seems misogynistic to argue that men, when intoxicated, are possessed of far more self-control or cognitive function than women. Is mutual accusation that courts must sort out the safest route? Consent forms seem a little excessive in a hookup culture, but I have seen getting written consent proposed seriously and mockingly (if we take it seriously, the problem with that would be proving the form wasn't signed under duress or that the person was competent enough to sign at the time).
In any case, sober sex is definitely the safest course of action.
**Tangential focus:**
Regarding the phrase ""believe women,"" as someone who has been a victim of cyber harassment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and false allegations at the hands of a former partner who was doing to me what she said I was doing to her, I think that we as a society need to reevaluate our interpretation of “believing victims” (regardless of gender). Specifically, the meaning of the phrase “believe.” My interpretation of believing victims is that we (the public, the justice system) should approach victims and perpetrators without preconceptions or prejudice. That is to say, putting aside preconceived notions and taking in and interpreting the facts of the case without judgment, in particular, while these facts are still coming out.
I have discussed this with colleagues at work and they've come to a similar consensus once we parse the language. Everyone certainly acknowledges that false accusations of sexual assault are far rarer than sexual assaults (which themselves are relatively rare as a subset of violent crime, generally, since crime and criminality themselves are relatively rare as compared to non-criminal conduct). What I am more concerned with here is how we determine guilt relative to mutual intoxication, or if we are developing a double standard in which men can consent when drunk and women cannot, thus rendering men rapists in cases where they could never be seen as legitimate victims themselves if the situation were reversed.
When I see someone accused of wrongdoing, I suspend judgment and wait for the facts. I don't assume the accuser or accused are telling the truth or lying, and I would hope that this should be the approach of law enforcement, as well. Meaning, they should listen to an accuser or victim without assuming things about her or him; for instance, they would listen without asking a woman why she was wearing a short skirt or why she was out drinking at 3 AM, or they would listen without asking a man why he didn't stop her if he didn't want it, and so forth.
That is, fundamentally, however, not “believing” victims in the sense of taking all their words as fact at face value. Yet, this appears frequently to be the way that this idea is interpreted. If I suspend judgment and observe facts without judgment as they come in, as I would hope police would when questioning an accuser and her or his accused, I feel pressured to side with the victim by default. But, I think that this does not capture the true spirit of ""believing victims"" that ought to be intended.
It seems to me that, while the justice system has a tendency to fail to handle many people who engage in sexual assault or domestic violence, the popular court of public opinion shoots firsts and asks questions later, and uses the above concept regarding belief wrongly. We too often fall on one extreme or the other in terms of 100% believing the victim or 100% victim-blaming, which I think happens just as often (men online immediately assuming the woman is lying, that is). Of course, the facts themselves need to be scrutinized fairly in the first place for this conversation to move forward in any meaningful way.
I hope this isn't too rambling. I am looking for a clearer feminist perspective on the varying variables of this topic, and have previously received some decent answers to questions here. I've not found reasonable satisfaction just from the people I know, and I don't think the #MeToo movement, which is still in its infancy, has reached the stage of addressing these nuances and issues yet, as it still fights for women's legitimization as victims at all (I don't fault it for that). Thank you!","Feminist perspectives, like criminal justice perspective, are in their infancy on the topic of drunk sex. College sex educators are just beginning to deviate from the binary of ""drunk = no consent.""
Psychologists and sexologists are working on questions like ""what does drunk consensual sex look like?"" "" How do we advise sexually active adults on incorporating alcohol in their sex lives?"" 
They're great questions. As for criminal justice, what you've said is correct. In most cases it's pretty clear if someone is committing sexual assault regardless of either person's intoxication levels: i.e: forcing oneself on a unconscious out drunk person is rape no matter how intoxicated either is. 
I think In more ambiguous ncases, more information besides alcohol level is going to determine if it is sexual assault, and who is the assaulter. Things like: Was someone violent? Did one person plan beforehand to get the other drunk and have sex with them? Was anyone coerced into sex?
In cases with similar levels of intoxication, all the other things that tend to indicate sexual assault, and help define consent are still hugely relevant. They might even be more significant than intoxication.

Why do the negative have to be associated with being a man and being masculine, but the positive is just associated with just being a good person, whether male or female?","Because nothing about gender roles or personality is actually inherent to any gender.
Women can be aggressive protective, or whatever else. Men can be nurturing and emotional.
Toxic Masculinity is more an idea that gender roles are so rigid and men are so heavily locked into one set ideal by society as to what a 'real man' looks like that they have to live to its extreme. So when you say being aggressive is a manly thing specifically, it means that men now have to live up to that idea.
The ideal would be to recognise gender roles are bullshit and stop using them. By letting people decide forthemselves what they want to be, without saying its 'not manly enough' (or of course the opposite, 'thats a mans job not a womans job').",13,1,1,1

TLDR: She hit three vehicles while drunk back in May of 2018, but her sentencing today was nothing. The judge (who is a woman if that matters) said (gonna heavily paraphrase, full quote in article) ""If she was a man I would punish her, but she hasn't committed a crime since then and since she has a drinking problem I'll let her free so she can fit it.""
Now the issue most people have is the first part (real quote): ""I f Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs"". This shows the judge has a bias against men or very much in favor of women. 
Ignoring that part though, it just seems like the judge wants her to get help rather than suffer in prison. Although that may be seen as ""controversial"", it's not inherently discriminatory or favoring.
But, I want to know what you think. General thoughts on this story.
I want to be clear, I do not believe the courts in general have a bias against men, and that is not what I am asking.

They want to work - great. They want to be stay at home moms - perfect. But is it though? I've never heard a positive SAHM story. It's always about men not appreciating the work that goes into being a SAHM, into women being trapped in the house doing manual labor, not having their own money. Even a good man can become an abuser after years of having this sort of power over their wife. After all, people aren't always born bad, they become bad due to circumstances, and I feel that the family structure of working dad and SAHM is one of the worst for women. 
Partly it's because of survival bias, but still, shouldn't feminism discourage women from being trapped in a very, very vulnerable position? Shouldn't feminism advocate more for women NOT being stay at home moms? Shouldn't they advocate for government daycare, or other ways that would make it easier for women to work? Yeah women can be whatever they want, but society seriously discourages women from becoming sex workers for example, shaming them for this choice. Shouldn't feminism similarly discourage women from becoming stay at home moms simply because it's very likely to end up in a depressed and stressed woman taking anti anxiety drugs, whose husband doesn't respect her and has power over her.","The thing is, being a parent and managing a household \*is\* a job. This is why ""wages for housework"" is a thing. So I do think families - and women - should have the ability to negotiate that work and also working for income(s) in a way that works for them. Especially when women who do work tend to do both that and the bulk of domestic/child-rearing labor, effectively having two jobs.
I think you do have a good point about economic power and dependency. Being the source of income for a family has insulated many a man from the consequences of his negative or abusive behavior, and I can see even well-intentioned SAHM arrangements becoming bad for the women in them, largely because they can be hard to leave once you are in one - it is hard to re-enter the workforce after being absent from it for several years.
That said, I don't think that's a reason to write off SAHM arrangements in principle. I think women should be educated about their options, and women who are SAHMs should have resources and groups available to them so that they don't become trapped. I also think businesses should be more open to hiring people, men or women, who have been ""out of the workforce"" for extended periods because they were doing domestic work.",12,0,0,0

Also I'm sorry this post is so long. 
I have EDS (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) which is a chronic health issue that can effect people in very different ways. For me it largely manifests in persistent weakness (I've never won an arm wrestling contest in my life) and joint weakness (I shouldn't armwrestle anyways because my shoulder may pop out) so I'm generally used to being the least physically capable person in the room. 
I've started tending bar at the place where my fiance works. He cooks and I just thought I would pick up some shifts since I have the time and they need the help. 
A woman was getting very, very drunk and the main bartender on had run out to grab some dinner since the kitchen at the bar didn't have what she wanted. I'd not denied anyone service before but I was uncomfortable serving this person any more, for the sake of simplicity let's call her Jane. 
Jane calls me back over to ask for another drink and I inform her I'm not going to be able to serve her any more because I don't think it's in her best interest. I offer to get her some food from the kitchen and promise they'll rush it. She does not take this well. 
She yells a lot and storms out of the bar. I go to bring some plates back to the kitchen as the main bartender returns from her dinner (and if I'm honest to see my fiance and get comforted, Jane was not kind with her words) and before I know what's happening my head is yanked backwards. I fall down on the ground and feel my shoulder come out of the socket. Jane has just come back in and yanked my off my feet by my ponytail. 
I panic and call for my boyfriend since the kitchen is *right there* and Jane manages to grab my hair again and is yanking my head around while I think trying to kick me. This isn't good for anyone but particularly bad when you have a disorder that basically makes you more prone to any kind of injury. What is whiplash for someone else would likely do real damage to my spine or worse. 
Fiance comes out of the kitchen and sees what's happening and grabs her arms, squeezes hard enough to break her grip but she was still kicking at me so he knocks Jane on her ass. He didn't actually punch her but he shoved her hard enough she hit a table and then the floor. Clearly he was concerned because I was on the floor being violently assaulted. 
Now comes my question for the feminists - my boyfriend is being criticised by the main bartender (an avid feminist) for what I see as defending me. Her logic is that he was out of line for shoving her away from me because 'a man shouldn't ever put his hands on a woman'. He won't budge one bit and after having time to see my stomach which is where she kicked mostly he says he wishes he actually did punch her. 
So is she just doing feminism wrong? Because this is exactly the kind of reason I don't consider myself a feminist and it's only reinforcing all those notions right now.

Is this criteria commonly used in feminist circles? Is it the de-facto definition of racism or is it only situationally used?**  
Nope -it is contextually used to separate out simple racial prejudice from institutional/structural racism. It is an encapsulation of the idea that to be racist you need to institutionalise your prejudice, which requires structural power. It is more that racism *requires* power + prejudice , not that it is power + prejudice.   
**I am aware there is a term Colorism that applies when someone from a marginalized ethnicity is prejudiced. Is there some criteria of what type of institutional power someone needs to have for any bigoted actions to be considered racist? Could there be such a thing as Institutional Colorism or is that basically the new definition of Racism?**  
Colorism is a bit more complex - it refers to bigotry against people *within* the same ethnic group. This ethnic group does not have to be marginalised either. For example, India is a deeply colourist society, and even though the country is run by Indians (meaning we hold institutional power and aren't marginalised in the country), fairer-skinned Indians are treated better.   
People of colour can also be racist against other people of colour as long as there is a relative privilege. ""Model minorities"" such as Asians (east and south) fit this and can perpetuate anti-black racism.   
  
**One of the things that makes this hard for me to process is something like Trumps ban on trans people in the military. To me this meets the criteria of 'Power plus prejudice' but would be transphobic, not racist. How would this be described in feminist circles? In addition I have seen Sexism defined as 'Power plus prejudice' as well. Wouldn't it be better to make the definition of bigotry be 'Power plus prejudice' and leave racism/transphobia/sexism as bigoty based to the associated characteristic?**

There *is* a more or less implicit notion among researchers that is more or less widespread (at least in Western countries) that the human condition is universal, at least for ""fundamental"" processes such as how we reason, how we form attitudes and opinions, etc. For example, reknowned psychologist of emotions Paul Ekman has a lot of research supporting his idea that there are [basic human emotions that are universal.](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1971-07999-001.pdf)
The DSM project is philosophically underpinned by the idea that like with (neuro)biological illnesses, one day experts will determine objective indicators of mental illness and then be able not only to cure them like we cured syphillis, but also prevent these illnesses like with vaccines (see [Andreasen](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/brave-new-brain-9780195167283?cc=pt&lang=en&) for this example). 
However, there are ongoing epistemological debates about what is mental illness, and there are scholars such as [Ehrenberg](https://www.persee.fr/doc/rfsoc_0035-2969_1999_num_40_4_5225) who contributed to a more sociological reading of mental illnesses, such that the notion of *depression* evolved and changed since Freud's era to today, together with changes in society. Whether his reading is convincing or not, it is true that we can trace a history of the notion of depression and see that it has changed. There are arguments to question how well the illnesses classified by the DSM apply elsewhere.
A similar issue exists for psychometric tests, there are important considerations to be made about culture and populations. Such that, what we consider to be intelligence is a specific manner of reasoning and problem solving which is valued and promoted in our societies, but not likewise in other societies. For example, tribal people are not *unintelligent* if they fail our tests, because they are arguably *intelligent* in their survival and hunting skills.

>Whether what intelligence tests measure is intelligence, on the other hand, is far more complicated as even a casual perusal of the field should reveal. Although many people assume that since intelligence tests exist, it must be possible for intelligence to be measured, **the fact is that intelligence is an abstraction, a construct we infer based on the data at our disposal and our own criteria**. As such, **it is not something everyone can agree on or quantify objectively**. Thus, **even among psychologists there is a wide variety of opinion about the meaning of intelligence**, depending on the perspective from which they approach the topic.
It is ultimately a label we apply to a set of skills we consider representative of [what we, in our culture, consider intelligence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693428/pdf/15347533.pdf). As argued by [Sternberg](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8206383_Culture_and_Intelligence):
>**Intelligence cannot be fully or even meaningfully understood outside its cultural context**. Work that seeks **to study intelligence acontextually risks the imposition of an investigator’s view of the world on the rest of the world**. Moreover, work on intelligence within a single culture **may fail to do justice to the range of skills and knowledge that may constitute intelligence broadly defined** and **risks drawing false and hasty generalizations.** 
In sum, an intelligence test built in one context can be (will be) in some way unfair to people from a different culture, as much as we make efforts to create 'culture-neutral' items. For example, not all human populations value abstract thinking as much as we do, giving much more importance to 'concrete' and practical skills and knowledge. At the moment I forget who wrote about the following, but an example would be a tribe which cared little about whether or not polar bears exist, while somewhat conceding that if the researchers were convinced they saw these white bears, then they exist for the researchers, but still do not 'exist' for themselves (the tribesmen) - the question itself made little sense to them.",3,1,1,1

> Freedle identified seven factors that seemed to affect the difficulty of  a test question. One of the most common was simple word repetition. If  an answer had a word in it that also appeared in the question, more test  takers chose it; thus a question was easier if it contained a word that  recurred in the correct answer, and harder if it contained a word that  recurred in an incorrect answer. In reading-comprehension questions  another factor was where in a reading passage the key part appeared. If  it was at the beginning or the end of the passage, the question was  easier than if it was in the middle.

Their example was a test question that mentioned a stand mixer, which is classist: affluent students are more likely to have one at home. I was not convinced; they said that really good examples are not public and refused to even hint what they might look like.
So, how does discrimination in standardized tests work?

A comment I’ve usually seen on social media in regards to women not wanting to go to a certain place or take an Uber or talk to a random guy because they fear being raped/assaulted...is that a rational position to have?
I’m a minority man. I’m probably in the top percentile of those who are liable to being assaulted. Men get assaulted more than women in all facets except for sexual assault. As somebody who’s been jumped, robbed, gotten their nose broken, etc on several occasions yet has also been sexually assaulted by a man, I guarantee that it isn’t as bad as being downright raped...I mean just two weeks ago, some guy tried robbing me, probably like the 10-15th time that’s happened to me in my life. 
Still, I don’t try to avoid certain routes, I don’t fear for my life when I go outside, I might be a little more paranoid but I haven’t exactly let that control my life. 
Maybe it’s just me but I feel like social media has kind of given people a misconstrued perspective on sexual assault, making it seem like it happens way more often than not, despite statistics dropping 75% over the past 30 years. Now whether that means that sexual assault is going down or people are too afraid to report it, I’m not sure. I would personally argue that the statistics have gone down because well, folks were too afraid to report it back then. 
Sorry if I went a little off topic. I somewhat take offense to people not wanting to deal with men because they have this fear. And before you say “if you’re offended, you’re part of the problem” that’s a logical fallacy and isn’t a legitimate argument. 
I mean I’ve had people cross the street when they see me, I try to cough really loud when walking behind a woman, etc. I understand the fear and it ain’t my place to change it but still, I just don’t think that prejudice and generalizations are the way to go. I’ve been robbed and beat up by mostly black dudes, if I use that as a justification for not wanting to hang out with black people, I would rightfully be called racist. 
Of course, be vigilant and pay attention to who you’re speaking to but at the same time, I don’t think it’s fair to be skeptical of every person you meet simply because they’re of the opposite sex. 
FWIW, I don’t give a shit if women acknowledge me or not. I’m not speaking about a specific instance but moreso the general social media culture that has sort of bred these ideals.","As women we have been told our ENTIRE lives we need to protect ourselves from men who will do us harm. We’ve been told not to wear certain clothes, to carry mace, not to walk alone at night, don’t get too drunk, or we might get sexually assaulted, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. Like somehow it’s on us to make sure we don’t get hurt. 
I would check this out: https://www.boredpanda.com/nut-kicking-analogy-brett-kavanaugh-case/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic
A man on twitter wrote about women’s experiences from a male perspective to help men better understand what women go through. It’s pretty impactful and I thought it did a pretty good job getting the point across. 
I don’t think the fear of sexual assault is irrational. Women are sexually assaulted all the time and never report it. I personally know many women who have been raped, molested, sexually assaulted, and/or harassed who have never reported it to the police. Men as well. People are recently starting to come out about it because the #MeToo movement has given women a platform to speak out and courage to fight back. 
Personally I do not like living in fear. I try not to worry about being attacked but it is always - I mean ALWAYS - in the back of my mind particularly if I am alone and/or outside at night. While most people and most men for that matter have no intention of hurting women, there are a large number of them who do have bad intentions. Just look at what’s going on in the news with Epstein and Trump taking advantage of little girls years ago. Unfortunately men have been predatory toward women for a long long time people are just now starting to speak up about it and say “no, this is not right and this is not ok.”
Anyways, long response but I hope this gives you some more perspective. Also I am very sorry to hear that you personally have been the victim of violence and sexual assault. No one deserves to be hurt or taken advantage of.",25,1,1,1

The findings were clear. The debate was over.

Of course, it was soon shown that his sample relied disproportionately on prison inmates, including those jailed for sex offenses, college students, and members of homosexual clubs and associations.

> I haven't read the full relevant literature, but this conversation has no actual discussion of data relevant to the question, or really discussion of the question so let me add what I can.  This [source](http://www.helenfisher.com/downloads/articles/INFIDELITY.pdf) promises some provisional answers that hopefully someone can build on (pg. 3):
>>*Infidelity was also widespread in former decades, and in historical and tribal societies. Reports in the 1920s indicated that 28% of American men and 24% of women were adulterous at some point after wedding (Lawrence, 1989). In the late 1940s and early 1950s, approximately 33% of men and 26% of women in an American sample were adulterous (Kinsey et al., 1948; Kinsey et al., 1953). Data in the 1970s indicated that some 41% of men and 25% of women reported infidelity (Hunt, 1974), and data collected in the 1980s suggest that 72% of men and 54% of women were unfaithful at some point during marriage.*
>Remember, the Kinsey sample is not truly a random sample (very white, very rural) but I imagine it's by far the most accurate direct data we can get of the period.  I have no idea what that study in the 20's is, but the numbers from the 70's and 80's seem far, far too high compared to other data.  What's the easiest source for a sociologist to get data from?  The General Social Survey (GSS), a survey that has been running consistently since 1972 and is really considered the ""gold standard"" for survey research.  I made a [chart](http://imgur.com/D8fYUlZ) for every the question ""Have you ever had sex with someone other than your husband or wife while you were married?"", but unfortunately the earliest they asked the question was 1991 (the levels been relatively consistent since then, with more or less 15% of people having been unfaithful at some point in their marriage).  
>So why are these GSS numbers for the 90's on so different from the numbers cited above?  Well, for one thing, attitudes towards adultery have changed slighlty.  While they only asked about commiting adultery in 1991, they have asked *opinions* about adultery every year since the survey started in 1972. Here's that [graph](http://andrewgelman.com/2011/10/14/the-general-social-survey-is-a-great-resource/).  Big take away: there's a slight rise from 70% of the population to 80% of the population saying it's ""always wrong"".  What did people think before that 1972?  It's hard to say.  Maybe the 70's were a low point for thinking adultery was wrong (free love!) or loosening divorce laws made adultery less necessary and acceptable.  If I had to make a guess based on the numbers I have in front of me (and I'd love people to find better numbers),  I would say this: the Kinsey report's numbers are probably high--while the GSS is a *nationally representative random sample*, Kinsey's report was neither nationally representative (I recall it being mostly white, for one thing) nor random; you can read more about it in the [Wikipedia article's section on criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Reports#Criticism).  Kinsey, for example, found 10% homosexuality in his sample, with about 1/3 of men having had a homosexual experience.  This is far on the high end compared to what later studies have found, though not out entirely of the ballpark.  As a corollary, I think we can assume because of their sampling method, the Kinsey numbers are likely on the high end of estimates for infidelity as well.  As for the studies cited above from the 70's and 80's, the fact that they're so different from the GSS numbers about infidelity (admittedly, not having read those studies) makes me think they're using either 1) a poor sample, either in terms of size or representativeness or both, or 2) a radically different notion of ""infidelity"", for example, one that includes all types infidelity in any romantic relationship, not merely sex with a partner other than one's current spouse, or 3) counting people who are deemed likely cheat in the future based on the behavior of previous cohorts.  I don't know and I don't care enough to read the actual studies.  Either way, with the relatively consistent GSS numbers (which are the gold standard for sampling, but for sensitive questions like this, are likely to under report due to social desirability bias) from the current era probably give a good lowish estimate and the Kinsey numbers probably give a decent higher limit.
>**TL;DR** how common was adultery in the 50's-60's?  Probably somewhere between about ~10-30% of people were adulterous at some point in their marriage.
And from a [different comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/36nknu/comment/crfqwb3) of mine again on /r/AskHistorians:
> One thing to note about the Kinsey studies is that they used a non-random sample. That doesn't mean you should ignore their work, of course, but that you should mentally add a fairly large ""plus/minus"" to all their numbers--especially in the minus direction. 10% of their male sample was ""predominantly homosexual"", while the current consensus in the research for studies since the 70's using more representative samples asking similar sets of questions finds about 3-6% of American men are homosexual.
>Unfortunately, you cannot download any of Kinsey's data (you have to request that the Kinsey people run regressions for you). A freely available data set from the 60's I found includes questions about kissing, petting, and coitus, but nothing beyond that (and even then this was about the acceptability for unmarried people in various contexts, not the frequency with which occurs for actual couples, married or not). I think that's most of the sort of things you get for early survey research.
>I am randomly working on a paper about sexual behavior, and it's just hard to get representative historical data. In part, this is because there isn't much after Kinsey until the rise of the AIDS epidemic, especially not that tried to be representative of the general population (there were attempts to do more targeted research). And even after AIDS, most surveys of sex that are funded are explicitly funded as health concerns (which means a lot of the interesting questions aren't asked). Look at this list of publicly accessible non-Kinsey data sets put together by the Kinsey people. There are very few that ask about specific sex acts, especially before the 1980's (at which point it is usually framed in terms of ""sexual risk"" rather than merely ""sexual behavior"").
The Kinsey studies are certainly the best available studies we have from this time but because of their non-random sample, they probably tend to misestimate the proportion of population engaging in acts. Subsequent studies seem to consistently show that they slightly (but not tremendously) *over*estimate the proportion of the population engaging in sexual acts.",5,0,0,0

About this petition, and the notion of child sexuality Foucalt says
>[But what is emerging - and indeed why I believe it was important to speak about the problem of children - what is emerging is a new penal system, a new legislative system, whose function is not so much to punish offenses against these general laws concerning decency, as to protect populations and parts of populations regarded as particularly vulnerable. [...] It could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired that adult, he may even have consented, he may even have made the first moves. We may even agree that it was he who seduced the adult; but we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, in every case, of being damaged and traumatized by the fact that he or she has had sexual dealings with an adult. [...] It is therefore within the new legislative framework - basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power - that a conception of sexuality and above all of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based; and it is one that is extremely questionable.](https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/attachments/foucaultdangerchildsexuality_0.pdf)
Also in defense of the petition, he highlights that his objections lie with statutory rape only, and that he was not supporter any notion of violent rape \([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Morality_and_the_Law)):
>""We took great care to speak exclusively of an indecent act not involving violence and incitement of a minor to commit an indecent act. We were extremely careful not to touch, in any way, on the problem of rape, which is totally different."" 
and
>""When we say that children are 'consenting' in these cases, all we intend to say is this: in any case, there was no violence, or organized manipulation in order to wrench out of them affective or erotic relations"", he completed.

For intersectionality, check out Angela Davis *Women Race & Class* and bell hooks *Feminist Theory From Margin to Center*.  Both include analyses of how the hierarchies and power structures built into patriarchy create a violent culture, and are decent descriptions of kyriarchy as well.
For rape culture, check out Rebecca Solnit's essay collection *Men Explain Things to Me*, particularly the essays ""The Longest War,"" ""Cassandra Among the Creeps,"" and ""Pandora's Box and the Volunteer Police Force.""   Another good one is the essay anthology *Ask : Building Consent Culture* edited by Kitty Stryker.
For patriarchy, sources from sociology and anthropology are good.  I liked Friedrich Engels *Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State* and Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha *Sex at Dawn*.
There are other places where feminism and criminology intersect as well, including the modern prison abolition movement as it relates to feminism and dismantling violent patriarchal culture, and the psychological tradition analyses of women's criminality which go back to Freud and Pollak and which you probably already know, and in modern times would be more informed by an understanding of patriarchy and institutional sexism.

As I am sure that everyone is already aware, America has influenced everyone and the American Dream, while vague on what it really is, has an impact on everyone.  It is an ideal that is about freedom, opportunity and making a difference.  
However, the deeper you go when you examine the culture, the more you realise how ironically paradoxical it is.
* For starters, one should look at the foundation of America when it was formed - it was meant to be the ideal place of libertarianism, except for a few demographics who had limited rights such as women [(particularly married women)](https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/essay/legal-status-women-1776%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C1830), [Native Americans](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-amgovernment/chapter/civil-rights-for-indigenous-groups-native-americans-alaskans-and-hawaiians/), and the [African Americans](https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/colonial-america-american-revolution-learning-resources/american-revolution-essays-timelines-images/african-americans-and-the-american-revolution/) (who were still slaves at the time)
* Similar to the ironies mentioned above, there are still a few mentalities that still persist even though certain mentalities have been tackled with in the past since the Civil Rights Movements such as [racism against African Americans](https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes#section-0) (although racist attitudes have decreased throughout the decades), [attitudes towards Muslims](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/) (which is still somewhat in the middle, not overall positive) and [attitudes towards immigrants](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/12/americans-immigration-policy-priorities-divisions-between-and-within-the-two-parties/) (which is divided between both parties)
* Attitudes towards war as America is often are often divided into two - [those who see America as a global police](https://www.npr.org/2008/02/20/19180589/should-america-be-the-worlds-policeman) and while also seen as a [warmonger because of its military-industrial complex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325813242_Military_Industrial_Complex_A_catalyst_for_conflicts_and_wars); or similar to America being seen as advocate for peace, there is still an issue about [purchasing firearms in America](https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/19/news/guns-background-checks/index.html) and [gun control](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12485) and incidents[ involving firearms in America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081)
* Attitudes towards alcohol in America are both [revered](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/americans-alcohol-study_n_598dcce8e4b09071f69932fd) yet also [stigmatised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998202/)
* Attitudes towards sex in America are both [revered](https://www.deseret.com/2011/7/31/20206966/sex-and-television-how-america-went-from-i-love-lucy-to-playboy-club#zooey-deschanel-top-stars-with-damon-wayans-jr-jake-johnson-max-greenfield-and-hannah-simone-in-new-girl) or [accepted](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/changes-americans-attitudes-sex-reviewing-40-years-data/) and also [stigmatised](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/genderandsexualitylawblog/files/2012/04/Sexual-Stigma-and-Sexual-Prejudice-in-the-United-States-A-Conceptual-Framework.pdf) (although this study is a bit old)

I cannot think of any more ironies to point out but I feel the pattern is clear - it is as though the culture of America has lots of ironies ... how come?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

I was a victim of domestic abuse for 4 years which varied from stalking/harassment, sexual assault, emotional, physical and financial abuse and coercive control. When I was pregnant with our son, my ex tried to push me out of the window of our 22nd floor apartment.
I have PTSD, Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Dissorder and Dissociation.
 In my experience, most discussions on domestic violence focus on the experiences of women when they are trapped in abusive relationships. Many people seem to be unaware that there can be lasting significant impacts on a person's mental state emotional wellbeing, finances and social wellness. This may result in a bias that once a woman leaves an abusive relationship, she should just move on with her life.

I hope this post will be left up, because I would genuinely like to do this and asking a new question about everything seems counterintuitive. Would you like to have an open dialogue?","I'm not coming from a place of total neutrality. I think I have a lot of the same views of feminism that a lot of men do. 
I don't know if I'll become a feminist. I'm a fairly stubborn person. But I have changed my views on issues before. I'm not closed off to doing so. 
I'll add a few and check back every now and again when I have time. I hope this post is allowed to stay. 
First, some things about feminism that I agree with and support. 
1. Encouraging men to open up and be vulnerable and not stoic and closed off all the time
2. supporting victims of male domestic violence. 
3. In many cases, speaking out against misandry
4. Allowing men to participate and be active in the feminist community
Things I disagree with feminists on
1. The wage gap. I agree the pay gap exists and there are many factors that contribute. But I don't think I've ever seen a study that concludes the wage gap exists. That for the same job and same hours worked women earn less than men. There are some pro-women websites that claim it does, but the data they cite is dubious at best and neutral sources say it does not exist. 
2. That women in particular are objectified. Men are often shirtless in movies and female characters often ogle men. I've heard male and female ""locker room talk"" and- I mean I'm biased and I didn't measure- but anecdotally I say it was about as objectifying as male locker room talk. 
Women suffer from eating disorders more (last time I checked, could be different now) and are more likely to have serious complications from body image. But I think part of that is to due with the fact that men often want to bulk up and women often want to become smaller or thinner. So whereas men might consume protein powders and garbage like that, women are more likely to stop eating which damages the body a lot more. 
Whereas for men... Some of the stuff men are insecure about isn't really ""fixable."" There are penis enlargement pills. There are hormone boosting supplements. But these don't work. Not eating makes you thinner... It also makes you very sick and weak and tired and depressed and being thinner isn't always a good thing.
My overall point is that, while men and women often have different ""ideal"" bodies they're aiming to get, I'm not sure men feel more confident about their appearance than women and I'm not sure men are objectified less. And, though many factors may contribute, short men do commit suicide more. 
3. That ""straight white men"" are controlling women's bodies, even though a similar number of women are deeply against abortion. 
4. Why feminists are against Christianity but seemingly supportive of Islam. I don't believe Islam is inherently bad, I think some people interpret it in a bad way. I have no issue with Muslims. But between the US and the middle east... It's clear where women are oppressed more by every objective metric imaginable. 
Some people use Christianity to oppress women, Some people use Islam to oppress women. Although Christianity nowadays isn't nearly as influential in America as Islam is in the middle east. I will defend refugees and Muslims and I will defend religious freedom. Many followers of Islam are great people. 
But Islam, as a religion, is built on many of the same principles as other religions. kings have absolute power granted by a higher power to rule over everyone else. I'm not singling out Islam, but I'm not sure why many feminists defend Islam despite the problems it's causing in the middle east. It's not friendlier towards or more accepting of women. 
This is more of a view many on the left have that does not make any sense to me. To reiterate, I don't think Islam makes good people do bad things. Good people will interpret Islam as peaceful and, say, give to the homeless based on the teachings. Bad people will interpret it as allowing violence and rewarding said violence with eternal bliss. It can help or it can hurt depending entirely on the character of the person reading it. 
The same is true for Christianity, but the left is often critical of Christianity and defensive of Islam. Makes no sense to me. 
5. Why feminists are against lyrics in some music, but not in rap. I've never bought into the whole ""music is a bad influence"" thing, but feminists are critical of some songs but appreciative of rap songs that are even more sexist. This is also true where slurs are concerned. F***** in Fairytale of New York (one of my favorite songs) is often censored. The song baby it's cold outside, pulled for being sexist. 
Rap songs often have f***** and far more overt references. But those don't seem to be discussed as often. 
Which brings me to the next category...
Things I really don't like about feminism...
1. The support of multiple seemingly contradictory ideologies and beliefs. It's impossible to both be pro LGBTQ+ and also defend the culture in the middle east, where LGBTQ+ people are killed. Intersectionality in general seems to try to fit different groups into neat little boxes, with straight white men oppressing everybody else. But statistically, white people are less homophobic than black people. That's according to surveys. So if anything it's worse to say f***** as an African American, given that homosexuals are often oppressed in African American communities. 
This isn't always the case. Dave Chappelle has been called out on transphobic jokes (but many prominent rappers seem to get a pass.) 
And there's a notion that saying this is racist. I don't think it is and,moreover, It's true. Surveys of people's views of homosexuality show what percentage of people from different groups support it. Too often Intersectionality seems to focus on straight white men and not on the complex dynamics between other groups. 
2. Sexism (in effect). Basically, feminists will argue that studies show women are naturally better leaders or perform better on STEM tests and have better emotional intelligence and linguistic ability, while simultaneously dismissing any claim that men are inherently better at some things than women. If women are as good as men across the board and better in some areas, isn't that saying women are biologically superior? 
3. How feminists look at Mens rights activists, often judging the entire movement by its worst parts, versus how they look at feminists, often dismissing the worst parts. The easy explanation is unconscious in-group bias, but I don't know if that's the reason feminists will give. 
That's enough for now. I'll add more (assuming I don't get banned) Some things worth mentioning. 
NOT ALL FEMINISTS
I don't have more of a problem with Islam than other religions. I don't think it's inherently better or worse. 
I don't think black people are ""bad"" because, on average, they are less tolerant of homosexuality. I think people are complex and that a full intersectional hierarchy would allow everybody to see more nuance and that those who are oppressed can oppress others.

I've already been to sites like Jezebel and EverydayFeminism, but I find them to be absolutely terrible. I've heard that these sites are popular, but ""popular"" is evidently not always a good thing.
My idea of a good feminist website:
**BALANCE**
Whenever I stumble upon a feminist website I find that 90% of the articles are about the struggles of women in wealthy, modern countries(top 10 OECD-level). While this perspective certainly is interesting, it becomes a bit repetitive. I also find it silly, considering that men have just as many gender specific issues and make up for 50% of the population. Feminism is important for both genders, but based on sites like Jezebel and EF it would seem like men's issues are swept under the rug. I refuse to believe that feminism is like this i 2019. Or at the very least, I refuse to believe that there aren't *any* sensible websites out there!
**WELL-WRITTEN ARTICLES**
It's a no-brainer, but I want the articles to be well-written. Apart from good English(it's not my first language, but I can usually tell), I want the foundation of the articles to be primarily based on actual research and facts, rather than personal experiences and anedotes. Some anecdotes are fine, especially when it's used to add ""flavor"" to the piece, but the entire premise shouldn't just be a personal story. At least not the majority of the time(some stories are obviously powerful and important).
**NO STRONG BIAS/POLITICAL AGENDA**
Maybe it's because I'm from Northern Europe, but I will always be annoyed when people assume that ""feminist = left-leaning"". I'm left-leaning myself and I can see that there is a correlation between leftism and feminism, but it's not uncommon at all to see feminists who lean towards the right side of the political spectrum. And that is *fine*. I'm here to read about *gender*. Nothing else. When I read about male disposability or sexual assault on women, I couldn't care less about your opinon on taxes or veganism.

It argues that the modern understanding of the term initially came not from the institution of slavery and systemic racism in the U.S. (ex: Slavery, Jim Crow, etc), but Nazi Germany’s persecution of its Jewish minority.
He also argued than within Weimar Germany, Jews were (compared to other Germans) doing better economically and perceived to have “power”.
Here is my question:
**- Is it true the modern use of the term “racism” originated from the Nazi persecution of Jews?**","The question about the origin of the term *racism* is answered - I concur, as a concept it was created in the first half of the 20th century.
Regarding the notion of defining racism as power plus prejudice, as far as I am aware of it originated in 1970. This idea appeared in Patricia Bido's book titled *Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-Media Social Studies Curriculum in Racism Awareness for the Secondary Level* which was then popularized in the book White Awareness by Judy Katz, in which you can [explicitly find the notion that](https://books.google.ch/books?id=25AaGpyRnE8C&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=Developing+New+Perspectives+on+Race:+An+Innovative+Multi-media+Social+Studies+Curriculum+in+Racism+Awareness+for+the+Secondary+Level&source=bl&ots=MqfcSbdGwf&sig=ACfU3U11AuWPNZB6_xOUno6P6N82m1UxWg&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4_NnzrovgAhUOZVAKHbIKBBgQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=power%20prejuidice&f=false) ""Third World people cannot be racist against Whites in the United States"".

That has a purpose - the intention is to get the most benefit out of scarce resources (presuming such resources are scarce & can only be used for one purpose - in your example I don't think actually prosecuting sexual assault will in any way reduce the ability of police to identify false reports. In fact, the same resources can pursue both goals in a fair system that actually investigates complaints, so it's kind of a bad analogy).

How correct is the number? Any way we can adjust for social desirability bias in respondents to conform to the political correct viewpoint?","There is always a risk of social desirability when asking about sensitive topics, and the solution is in the [survey methodology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2420150303) in order to **prevent** and/or to ask questions made to **detect** social desirability, such as with the bogus pipeline (not feasible for these kinds of surveys).
I do not think it is possible to ""correct"" the numbers if the Gallup's methodology is flawed, as it is a hidden bias. Unless there are measures to detect the bias, we cannot actually say how many people in their sample gave an answer they deemed more socially acceptable than their ""true"" answer, unless you can compare with other instruments that are considered to be valid.
For the specific poll, [I can see they do take into account some recommendations](https://news.gallup.com/poll/235793/record-high-americans-say-immigration-good-thing.aspx) from the literature on survey methodology, such as defining the terms clearly, avoiding questions that suggest an expected answer (asking ""should immigration be kept at its present level, increased or decreased?"" instead of for example ""should it be increased?"" or ""should it be decreased?"") and them asking to half of the sample about ""immigration"" and the other half ""legal immigration"" is interesting too. **But** it *is* a simple poll that does not appear to employ techniques to prevent and detect social desirability bias besides making sure it asks questions in the proper manner. What is the actual percentage? As far as I am concerned, another survey would be required to answer that.
If we assume that the ideological climate is still one in which supporting immigration is perceived as more socially acceptable than opposing it, then we can assume that it is lower than 75%. For illustrative purposes, [this study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956441) found a significant difference of 19% between directly asking about ""support for immigration restrictionism"" (according to Gallup data) and using a method called the list experiment to reduce the risk of social desirability, such that Janus's estimate was that there were more people opposing immigration than supporters.

Thus, my question for social scientists is: **In what areas of society might donations today have the highest chance to advance the fight against racism in the long term, and are there any studies to support it?** In other words, is donating to police reform getting at the heart of the issue, or is it just a band-aid for deeper root issues (e.g. education, joblessness, etc.)?
I can do the research into charities by category and ensure I'm picking one with good accountability/transparency to make sure this doesn't break rule 7.

Social media has allowed women to be at the forefront of choosing a dating partner without the input of other men. They can 'window-shop' and judge a man solely by how he presents and perceives himself compared to how other men perceive him. Before women would observe how a man fit in with other men (e.g. how dominant they were, how competent they were compared to their peers) and select the men based on this.
However women are biased by their sexual attraction to males, which influences how she perceives the mans character i.e. more physically attractive to women means better character subconsciously during first impressions.
Of course after dating for a period of time she can better judge a mans character but other things get in the way. They become infatuated by the man due to the chemicals released during sex (nowadays sex ofter happens very early in the relationship not after marriage when the woman could better judge the man she was dating without the hormones released during sex) and this in turn means that they are more biased.

I do have this post saved on my computer, in case it needs to be taken down.  In honesty, I'm unaware of a subreddit that directly applies to the issue. I tried to google search ""disorganized colleges"" and the only results were for disorganized *students*.
**Background**:  My degree is in anthropology, and I'm about to graduate with another degree in mortuary science, from a mortuary college. (I can edit this to include more info if necessary).
**Why I'm Here:**  
I--along with numerous peers--are severely dissatisfied with the learning institution we're at.  Our course evaluations have just opened, and we also each have an exit interview scheduled with the president.  Mortuary schools are very small; my cohort has 27 students.  Mortuary schools also tend to be few & far between, comparatively with standard universities & community colleges, which can make it slim-pickins with options.  My peers and I have so many grievances that we're unsure of where to start, and this is where I'm hoping to find guidance in streamlining our emotions into something coherent, intelligent, academic, and somewhat-professional.
* From day one in orientation, the speech given by our school's president included advice that upon going out into the funeral profession, **it would be best for us to keep quiet and keep our heads low.**  To contextualize this, our president is a white male in his 60s, and mortuary schools are now 95% female students.  To further contextualize this, the funeral industry is lagging way behind in just about everything--they are very traditional.  Hell, there are funeral homes that still have typewriters.  The funeral industry is an a unique place in time where it is just now shifting--well, it's trying to. Females now dominate mortuary student attendance, as well as licensed professionals. However, the small percent who still actually own and control things within the industry are those older males.  In today's political climate, more than a few of us students have a problem with this opening statement. 
* The college **fear-mongers students** into deleting their social media accounts, by taking screen shots of former students' posts on various platforms, and blasting these screen shots from the projector in the auditorium.  Typically, they take screen shots of former mortuary students (from their college or others) who now have more prominent influence on social media, and they tell current students in orientation about how bad this is, about how much lashback the student received, or how they couldn't find a job.  Funny thing is, I know a lot of these former students so I contacted them to *firstly* tell them that is happening, to which they were appalled because they were completely unaware.  *Secondly*, their response was that they've had zero issues with any of these things, and that as always, you just have to be aware of what you're putting out there. In summary, the only person/group that seems to have the issue is the mortuary school, and they're perpetuating their own problem while simultaneously shaming former students in the process of fear-mongering current students.  
   * I experienced this first-hand. I often talk about bones, autopsies, true crime, archaeology, and just about anything related to such, on my social media accounts.  I absolutely love it--it's one of my passions.  One day, I was pulled into the president's office where he started by saying, ""I'm not sure if this was you--honestly, it doesn't even matter...""  and he proceeded to reprimand me (with an instructor by his side) about one of my own posts.  This post was a *selfie*, of *me*, and my content was about how fascinating the human body is and how beautiful & meaningful it can be to work with autopsies.  Mind you, we sign privacy agreements which state that we won't walk into our clinical embalming lab and start taking pictures of cadavers, or talk about anything specific we've done in their lab.  ***I was not doing any of those things***.  I had not violated any privacy agreements.  I said to them, ""You do realize that my background is in anthropology, and that I talk about all of these topics in relation to anthropology, archaeology, and culture.  And I will continue to be talking about these things.  And what I'm talking about in this post--that you aren't sure is me or not, which, it is, because I can clearly see the printout in front of you--is something that occurs in NUMEROUS places & disciplines outside of your school. In fact, I have been a part of these things outside of your school, before I was ever a student here.""
* **Flippancy** is a large part of the problem, as well.  We were promised to be shuttled to our state's Funeral Directors Association conference where we would also have a job fair with prospective employers for our apprenticeships.  Most of the students plan to be licensed in this state. The president of our school canceled our trip, and had one of our instructors deliver the bad news. Many of us emailed our instructor lengthy concerns that she said she would forward to the president as long as they were appropriate.  You better believe I had a two-page paper on how all of the issues with this school can be seemingly unrelated, much like random symptoms yet to be connected to an illness, but all of the issues rippling out are coming from one rock--this school. Come to find out, the president of our school has personal ""beef"" with the funeral directors association, and that's why we weren't going.  When the president of our state's funeral directors association found out about this, she said she would pay for our entire trip just so we'd be able to still go.  After that, our school president came into the auditorium to give us a presentation on how the funeral directors association sees our school as a threat, because our school also provides continuing education courses.  Our school president loves to hear himself talk; dude has never had a bad day in his life. 
* During his presentation on how awesome he is, a couple of students--through a simple google search--discovered that our school president was also fired from Arlington National Cemetery (ongoing issues with misplaced bodies, etc, etc). This information throttled our trust for his capability to run *anything*, into the ground. 

Our cohort started in the fall of 2018.  The mortuary program is 12 months long for an associate's, and 16 months long for a bachelor's.  It is split into 4 semesters, running straight through the summer: S1 (semester 1), S2 (semester 2), S3 (semester 3), and S4 (semester 4).  If you're only doing the associate's degree, you only go until S3. Only two states require a bachelors to be a licensed funeral director & embalmer--our state being one of them--but you just have to have a bachelor's in *anything* plus the associate's degree from an accredited mortuary school, luckily for me.  
* We are currently wrapping up S3, so I'm almost finished. However, while we were in S2, the new S1 cohort onboarded, and their tuition was raised, but the school did not raise tuition for us, who were S2 students at the time.  Now, partly through our S3, our cohort receives a letter that our tuition will be raised in the 4th semester, ""In order to continue providing excellent education in mortuary service.""  The tuition raise itself wouldn't be a problem, since many high-education schools do this... but it's typically done school-wide, not by your level in school (freshman, soph, etc). We're bothered by the flippancy in these rules.  
* The other issue is that in semester 4, you're only in school for half of the semester.  The last half, you're doing a co-op in a funeral home that the school places you in.  The 4th semester is also the most expensive semester.  This doesn't add up in the eyes of many of my cohort peers.  The way I personally see it, is that I'm not paying $7,000 for that last semester to go work for free for the last half of it (which in the funeral industry, is non-stop on-call run-you-into-the-ground & burn you out work) and to do celebrant training which I could just pay $1000 to do outside of that college.  Of course, S4 doesn't apply to me since I'm not staying, but it applies to 24 students in my cohort who have huge problems with this.  The school is opening a new cremation education center, to which hundreds of thousands of dollars is being donated in equipment, etc.  The newest onboarding cohort is also capped out at 60 students.  These things are why we've heard that the tuition raise is now applying to our cohort.  But, we're just about out the door, and none of these things are things that we are going to see--the new center won't be available to us, but it'll be ready for the cohort behind us. 
I've been forward with my concerns regarding this institution.  I'm also well-known as a progressive thinker who is unafraid to ask challenging questions in any situation I'm in.  Cue some more:
* The president pulled me into his office for a second time, alone, and told me that ***I would never find a job in a funeral home***. Jumping back to his presentation on why we weren't going to our state's conference, another student asked if she could speak freely, to which the president said ""of course"" and she told him that he should have been the one to tell us that we weren't going, not our instructor, especially since he was the reason we weren't going.  That student has now been ghosted by every prospective employer that she has had even *good* interviews with. 
* The **nepotism** in this learning institution is rampant.  In the funeral industry, the community is small and everyone knows everyone.  If you come from the family business, you're far more likely to receive better treatment, to receive better scholarships, and to be heard more from your school.  I am *not* one of them.  I am actually the first person in my family to go to college, let alone be going for multiple degrees. 
   * Our instructors provide different due dates for different students regarding making-up work.
   * Our instructors have obvious & blatant bias towards certain demographics of people in the industry, particularly those who are more ""modern,"" up with technology, or who want to progress the funeral culture in the United States. 
   * I have a 4.0 GPA and perfect attendance, and was told that ""the school is unable to provide you with a reference letter.""  You're also unable to receive a reference letter from individual instructors; even if an individual instructor writes it for you, it is ""on behalf of the college"", and has to be approved by the president of the college.  You at least see my personal problem, here. Regarding personal references, no student is allowed a personal reference from any faculty member unless the student prints & signs a waiver which--you guessed it--has to go through the president for approval. So, for example, if I've personally known an instructor since middle-school, I would be unable to list them as a personal reference solely because they are now employed by this school. 
* A handful of students wanted to air their grievances with **the board of trustees** of our mortuary school.  However, they are unable to locate any direct contact information for the board members.  There are only photos & names of the board members, with the contact information being the email address of *the special assistant to the president*. Students--having paid their tuition--believe that they should be able to access the board, and furthermore, that they should be able to attend board meetings and be aware of changes, especially changes that are going to affect them. 
* Upon the arrival of this president, he created **two new positions** that did not exist before: *special assistant to the president* and *COO*. This has concerned us in that these would typically require a higher salary, and many students do not believe that this was beneficial to anyone, especially with a president who many believe are incapable of properly running an institution.  However, we do not have access to information regarding salaries, or even where the money goes to.  We only know that our school receives huge tax breaks because it is a private, non-profit school. 
* **Attendance Policy:**  I am the first physically disabled student to attend this college since it began in 1882. The school has no disability or student relations department, so I relayed my accommodations to the instructor that has been there the longest.  I missed a clinical lab day last semester, and the absence was listed as unexcused, resulting in a ""B"" in that course.  I simply copied & pasted from the ADA website regarding medical absences due to disability, and the clinical lab director changed my grade.  Now, upon starting our current semester, the lab director stated a new attendance policy.  In our first day this semester, she stated that students are only allowed one absence from each class.  Any further absence from a class will count the student as ""absent"" whether it's excused or not.  Any more than one absence per class will result in a drop in your class grade.  When we ""excuse"" an absence past the first one, it only means that you can make up the work that day in that class, but the absence will still count against your grade.  Then, she looked me dead in the eye from the podium and said, ""No outside institution has any ruling or power in deciding what your absence is."" This policy in itself creates an even strong classism, in that any typical American is set up to fail.  We live in a society that is fast-paced and multi-faceted.  People are doing multiple things all of the time.  People have to get their kids to school. People have doctors appointments.  People get sick.  This is atrocious.  And to boot, the instructor who relayed this new policy has missed about 5 of her own classes this semester.  *Does she get docked her pay?*
* **Assignments**: On a regular basis, we have an instructor telling us that something is due on this day, and then later on we find out that it is either due earlier or later than the original due date.  For our capstone, we have been misinformed numerous times on what to do with our paperwork-- we were never even given a date for when each group's paperwork is due.  We also have one instructor giving us times for something, and then another instructor giving us a different time for the same thing.  We'll have one instructor telling us a policy for something, and then hear something different from another instructor.  Then, we're the ones reprimanded for questioning what the hell is going on in this place.  This stuff happens on a ***weekly*** basis. 
* Our women's bathroom has 2 sinks, and the right-side sink has been out of soap for 2 months.  The left-side sink has now been out of soap for a week.  We have had no soap in the women's bathroom for a week now.  We haven't had paper towels in there for a few weeks.  The day the auditor came (just a few days ago), we noticed that some paper towels were thrown in the machine... but they aren't the right ones.  They don't even fit, and it doesn't dispense paper towels.  We ask, *where the hell is our money going to if you can't even get a proper cleaning crew?*
* Our clinical lab was out of essential products necessary to conduct embalmings.  We again ask, *where the hell is the organization and where the hell is our money go to?*
* This school claims to be ""The Harvard of Mortuary Schools"" yet we have no intellectual stimulation beyond the materials thrown at us in order to pass our National Board Exams.  An instructor quotes someone who was essential in developing restorative arts, who said that a school who just throws NBE material at students is not a learning institution; critical thinking and theory are essential to learning.  We don't get that here.  Many of us are honestly disappointed, and we expected more from a school that claims such a high name.  We're taking around 22 credit hours a semester, with NBE material thrown at us from left & right, and then our instructors shame us for not being able to come in and volunteer in the lab, or for not being able to go over and interview with a funeral home owner that stopped by the school... and we're all thinking *how in the hell do you expect us to do any of that?  we've all had to quit our jobs to handle this load!  and on top of that, the attendance policy is completely unrealistic in contemporary society!  simply penalizing a student for merely being unable to be physically present but would otherwise still excel in courses is simply just spiteful, and we don't see how it could be anything else!*
Every student in my cohort came here intending to work in a funeral home.  I cannot say that this is the case now.  We have had zero positive reinforcement in anything we've achieved.  They've consistently told us that most students fail the NBE, and that we should be studying more.  Some of us don't even sleep.  Not to mention, the NBE exam questions come from a small group of people based in Arkansas, which is just *not* representative of the progression and practices occurring within the funeral profession.  Not only is this mortuary school completely lacking communication between faculty, but the organizations lack clear communication between each other as well.  From the NBE boards, to the state funeral directors associations, to the mortuary schools, **no one** is one the same page. 
I could say more, but damn, this is lengthy. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read it, and I just truly need assistance streamlining our thoughts into something cohesive. In my eyes, all of this stuff--even the little stuff--ripples out and it affects the students on a huge mental & emotional level.  I do not feel that this school has been conducive to any sort of positive learning environment.",This submission has been removed as it's not a social science question.,1,0,0,0

- ""I wouldn't rape you, because you're too ugly.""
- ""You should shave.""
- ""Can I piss in your mouth?""
- ""Do you shave down there?""
- When I and some other girls tried to discuss something, we were referred to as ""hens"" that ""cackled""

At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.
On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:
* They’re universal across human cultures 
* They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
* Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
* The underlying traits are highly heritable
* They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.
Personality differences
Women, on average, have more:
* Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
   * These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
* Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher agreeableness
   * This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences and there’s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men without support.
* Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance)
   * This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.
Note that contrary to what a social constructionist would argue, research suggests that ""greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits."" Because as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality traits becomes wider.” We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.
Men’s higher drive for status
We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.
Status is the primary metric that men are judged on4, pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths.
Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap
Below I'll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits between men and women that I outlined in the previous section and suggest ways to address them to increase women's representation in tech without resorting to discrimination. Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I think it's still instructive to list them:
* Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things
   * We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits to how people-oriented certain roles at Google can be and we shouldn't deceive ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our programs to get female students into coding might be doing this).
* Women on average are more cooperative
   * Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. Recent updates to Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there's more we can do
   * This doesn't mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn't necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like what's been done in education.
* Women on average are more prone to anxiety
   * Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.
* Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average
   * Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech
* The male gender role is currently inflexible
   * Feminism has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a society, allow men to be more ""feminine,"" then the gender gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for traditionally ""feminine"" roles
Philosophically, I don't think we should do arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women. For each of these changes, we need principled reasons for why it helps Google; that is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google's diversity being a component of that. For example, currently those willing to work extra hours or take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and if we try to change that too much, it may have disastrous consequences. Also, when considering the costs and benefits, we should keep in mind that Google's funding is finite so its allocation is more zero-sum than is generally acknowledged.","The response? Very sexist. Amusingly blind to how sexist it is.
And, perhaps most of all, shockingly ignorant regarding biology. Now, to be fair, I took an honors biology course in high school. Still, my high school biology spotted his foolishness.
**Perhaps most importantly. Even if Damon is right, it is a reason for Google to discriminate against men, not women. Every single thing he mentions is a reason why women are BETTER employees for Google than men. Teamwork, perhaps largest among all. If you seriously believe in a biological difference in psychology, that is a reason for Google to NOT hire men. Do you really want to go down that path? Everything you list - showing more interest in people building than things, being cooperative/a good teammate, being more aware of potential dangers to self/team/company, being more balanced in life & less likely to pursue extreme, unhealthy behavior, the supposed superiority of women in overcoming bad social messaging. Everything you list is a reason for people like Damon - or you - to never be hired by Google when they could hire a woman instead. And you argue this is reality?**
> At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership.
A statement based on rigorous research, by the way.
> They’re universal across human cultures
True for none of the differences Damon claimed to have observed.
> They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
True for none of the differences Damon has claimed to have observed.
> Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
Irrelevant to the traits Damon claimed to have observed. And to your above statements, obviously (David Reimer was still subject to social messaging).
> The underlying traits are highly heritable
True for none of the differences Damon claimed to have observed. AND irrelevant to gender differences. (The overwhelming majority of our genetics is not on the Y chromosome & therefore not specific to either gender.)
> They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
That is incorrect. It comes from an ignorance of evolutionary theory & pre-history mankind.
> Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” 
Great. So we can stop right here, acknowledge Damon was wrong and an idiot for not taking into account individual differences being self-selected by chosen field, toss his junk into the garbage on the basis of the above statement alone, right?
No, we can't? Because you're just saying that as a ""don't truthfully tell me that I like discrimination"" disclaimer rather than actually admitting Damon was wrong and an idiot? Because you actually like the idea of discrimination like Damon proposed? Sigh. Let's continue.
> I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences
You have absolutely zero scientific basis for this. It was pulled out of your ass. Or you believed the shit pulled out of someone's ass.
I know this because of the basics of philosophy of science. It is not possible for us to construct scientific experiments to prove what you said because it is not possible for us to construct scientific experiments that are free of social pressures/impacts on psychology. Including gender roles. The variable of social training cannot be removed, ergo there is no possible scientific proof to your claims. It is important to remember again that these supposed psychological differences are NOT found across all cultures.
> Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
Even if, for the sake of argument, we believe this is true, there is no reason to believe that isn't the result of training. Women receive vastly more training in the above as a child than men do, on average. So there is zero reason to believe in consistent underlying gender psychology. Just in the effectiveness of training.
> These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
More guesses pulled out of your or someone's ass and treated as if they are real. And, lest we forget, who cares? Individuals at Google, even if they are unusual individuals, do not deserve discrimination because other people of their gender are different from them.
>  research suggests that ""greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits.""
Correlation does not equal causation. Please look it up. Also, such research has nothing to do with capability at performing in a tech company.
> We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.
This betrays a shocking ignorance of what higher-status jobs are actually like. Did you think company leaders are treated like mid-level managers? LOL, no. Being tried & stressed leads to bad strategic decisions. It would be foolishness to the point of losing vast amounts of profit for a company to work its higher-status people like you suggest they do. Once again, I have to point out that, if you are right, it shows that men are vastly inferior for high-level leadership jobs. Where knowing people's skills and being able to delegate tasks to free up executive time is incredibly important & being too status-hungry to relinquish controlling authority is pretty dumb & inefficient.
> Status is the primary metric that men are judged on
LOL, nice job othering women without even realizing it. Status is also the primary metric we use for women. It is the sources of social status that differ, not status itself.
> Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths
This is just ignorant. Those forces are called sexism preventing women from being hired. Women not wanting those jobs is not at all why women are not in those jobs. And you have zero research showing so (I know, because there is no actual research showing so). Again, pulling shit out of your ass & believing it because you want to believe it. Don't worry though. I recognize you are a unique individual and are not using your example to assume all men are this ignorant of science & use of evidence.
> Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap
No need. By your own description, women are a vastly superior employee. Just remove the sexism preventing women's success and - according to you - there will be a different gender gap, with men locked out of corporate leadership & tech.

>Why I Am Not A Feminist
>Dear Tumblr,
>Most especially, Dear Feminist Tumblr. I get asked all the time online why I am not a feminist. I’m accused of internalized misogyny, of hating myself, of blindly following the commands of men, and of not appreciating the struggles of women (despite being a woman myself). I’m going to lay out for you the reasons I am not a Feminist™.
>1.) The Condescension Towards Women 
>Feminism is, as of late, an extremely condescending movement. It’s not something people do because they care, it’s a feel-good crusade, and it’s hateful towards women who don’t fit the narrative and don’t swallow the rhetoric. Tell a feminist you are both a woman and not a feminist and you will hear a variety of phrases, including “You don’t understand feminism”, “You must hate yourself”, and my favorite that i’ve seen, “Stop letting pervy old men tell you what to do lol”. They all boil down to a single answer: “You are stupid and you don’t know what is best for you, let me tell you what to do.”
>It’s infuriating for me, an intelligent person, to be told that I’m stupid and can’t be trusted to make my own choices. Which brings me to…
>2) They Think We’re Too Weak To Consent To Sex
>I’ve seen 3 different posts in the past week and a half saying that women do not have to ability to consent to heterosexual sex. 3 posts, from supposed womens rights champions, insisting that we don’t have the capacity to make that choice, that we don’t have that ability. That we are too weak to fight men off and that we say yes because we have too, that we don’t enjoy sex. 
>That’s not just wrong, it’s a goddamn affront to all women who enjoy sex. It’s rude, it’s condescending, and it’s misogynistic to suggest that we don’t know what we want and that we need a guide to explain and make choices for us. 
>That’s the opposite of what feminism was originally about, and honestly..
>3) They Are Massively Hypocritical
>There are…numerous examples of feminist hypocrisy that I could dreg up, but I’ll stick to the big ones. One of the tenents of  feminism is that you shouldn’t be shammed for your body. Self love, and all that crap. The problem is that they turn around and demonize women who wear makeup to look pretty for men, or who shave their vaginas for sex reasons. Part of self love is loving how you look, and if they love looking sexy for others, you have absolutely no right to tell them they can’t do that. That is THEIR body, NOT yours, and you have no right to tell them what they can and can’t do with it. 
>Another thing is the habitual protection of female predators, Lena Dunham being a prime example. Bribing your younger sibling to masturbate in bed with you is not normal behavior. That’s pedophilia, and had a man done it, they would be out for blood. Yet they make excuse after excuse for Lena Dunham. 
>Yet another example of their hypocrisy, is that when Brianna Wu received (fake) death threats, they were outraged, scandalized. They made it known that this was the Worst Thing That Ever Happened…while they told transmen, boys, and basically all males to kill themselves. 
>I can also guarantee, despite the cries of “pissbaby tears” is response to #NotAllMen, we will be seeing a hell of a lot of #NotAllFeminists…more than usual. Which doesn’t surprise me because really,
>4) They Are Extremely Hateful Even To Each Other
If you are a feminist and you put one toe out of line in the community, you are viciously attacked. 
>A good example being Emma Watson. She wasn’t radical enough and as a result, was labeled a ‘Mayo"" feminist (read: white, because feminists are RACIST AS FUCK). There were posts, tweets, even articles criticizing her for not being a raging dickfuck about her views. 
>Not that the fact that they eat their own in any way surprises me because in reality, 
>5) Feminists Are Fucking Evil
>http://feminists-please-stop.tumblr.com/post/108095542707/what-are-exactly-the-actions-of-modern-feminists
>That link will take you to the master of all master posts. Highlights from which include:
>Feminists threatening a woman over her saying men need abuse shelters
>Shutting down forums for battered husbands
>The Primary Aggressor laws
>cover ups on female domestic violence 
>sexually assaulting and spraypainting crying, praying men who were protecting their church from vandalism by acting as a human shield
>Defending female pedophile teacher who raped 5 boys
>claiming raping an  year old boy is not rape
>and many more literally evil things. 
>So no, I am NOT a feminist and no, it’s not because of men. Feminists are why I don’t need or want feminism.

*MRAs: What They Are, Who They Are, What They’re Fighting For*
>Dear Tumblr,
>There are a lot of questions that have been floating around this site about what MRAs are, what they do, what they want. I’m here to answer these questions!
>1) So, what ARE MRAs?
>MRAs are Mens Rights Activists. It’s a group of both men and women who are concerned about certain areas of society where men are at a marked disadvantage. Basically feminism for men, taking on mens rights issues. 
>2) What issues are they taking on? 
There are several problems men actually do face in society!
>- Rape
>Men who have been raped (especially by a woman) are dismissed, laughed at, told they wanted it and enjoyed it, and used as punchlines in popular shows. They are seen as less worthy of sympathy and help than female rape victims, and MRAs fight to fix this inequality, by changing the wording of the law so that “forced to penetrate” is included in the definition of rape. They also oppose the number of false rape accusations. 
>- Domestic Abuse
>Men are seen as the primary aggressor in nearly every case of domestic abuse, despite being the victim at least 40% of the time. MRAs hope to combat this by making male victims more visible and attempting to do away with the ‘primary aggressor laws’, which basically assume that the one thats bigger (ie, the man) is arrested on a DV call. They also seek to set up mens shelters.
>- Custody and Family Law
>The Tender Years Doctrine (set into family law in 1839 by Caroline Norton) assures that women are given custody of the child most of the time, whether its in the best interest of the child or not. MRAs hope to make the laws more balanced so that fathers are not frozen out in custody battles. They also hope to make the laws regarding child support, alimony and communal property laws more fair.
>- Reproductive Rights
>There have been several cases where a woman would rape a man and then force him to pay child support for the child resulting from the rape, or where a man did not want a child and was forced to raise it anyway. MRAs want to be able to give up parental rights in exchange for not having to raise or help care for a child conceived of rape, deception, or with the purpose of collecting money (an unfortunate occurrence). 
>- Dangerous Jobs
Men die on the job far more frequently than women, and thats a problem. MRAs seek to correct this as well. 
>- Suicide Rates
>Men are more prone to suicide than women. MRAs seek to set up more help lines for men on this issue. 
>- Circumcision
>See my post on circumcision 
>- Education
>Boys routinely do worse than girls in school lately. MRAs want to find out why and fix it
>There are several more issues, these are just off the top of my head. 
>3) But I heard they hold some really nasty views! 
>Yes, some do. It is unfortunate, but sometimes people suck. Its not a perfect movement.
>4) Are YOU an MRA?
>I appreciate their struggles and their fight, but I tend to distance myself from any group that only focusses on one gender or the other. 
>5) Why do you think they are better than feminists if you aren’t one?
>I don’t. They are not better, per se, but they are, to my knowledge, less…aggressive. I’ve yet to hear of an MRA group attacking, sexually assaulting, or spray painting women to make a point about abortion, nor have I heard of an MRA group shutting down a forum about suicide by accusing the person running it of abuse, rape, ect not because any of those things were true but just to shut down the forum.

>On Race, Racism, and Hurt
>Dear Tumblr,
>When I was a child, we moved into a new neighborhood. We were poor, and it was a big house that we could easily afford. We were around the corner from a daycare center that would allow us to hang out after school, for free, until my mom could come and pick us up. It was me, my cousins, my sisters, my mother and my aunt. We were dirt poor, scraping by on child support, EBT, and mom and aunt’s tiny paychecks. It wasn’t perfect, but we were pretty happy. There was really only one problem.
>We were the wrong color. 
>We were in a neighborhood where our skin color caused problems. My sisters were beat up, toys became weapons, they were called names, their things stolen and smashed. My cousins suffered the same treatment, and were mocked for speaking the wrong language. 
>Our dog was threatened regularly, called dangerous. He was attacked more than once, and they tried to shoot him. They hit another dog in stead, an innocent passerby, and it died in our yard. 
>Later, we moved to a new neighborhood. We thought it would be different there, but it wasn’t. Our skin was still a problem.  
>My middle sister was growing into her looks, so she was harassed almost constantly. My baby sister got it worse. They caught her outside one day and they shot her in the back with boiling water. She blistered and cried. One of them pitied her just enough to douse her a second time with cold water. I didn’t take it well. I’m pretty big, and I’ve always had a temper. I took after them with a broken broom. Their mother sheltered them. She called me a slew of nasty names and threatened to call the cops.
>We moved not long after that.
>My cousins weren’t having much more luck. They were in a different town, in a different state. Their mothers new boyfriend was a racist, he forbid them from speaking their second language. The kids at school called them nasty names. Called them half-breeds. Cut chunks of their hair and verbally abused them if they refused to let them touch/cut/play with their hair. 
>I escaped most of the physical attacks. I was big, I was stronger than most. They’d heard stories about me, that I had a nasty temper, I was a biter, I hung around THAT GUY, my cousin was so-and-so, big time drug dealer. I was a satanist, I was on drugs, I could move a fridge with my bare hands, I had berserker rage. 
>I still got the shit end of the stick on words. They were the kind of words that cut and stung.
>They hated us because we were the wrong color. 
>They hated us because, despite us being children, with no choice, we were in ‘their’ neighborhood , in 'their’ space. 
>There are people here on Tumblr, the 'bastion of tolerance’, that defend their behavior. They say they were right to do what they did, because we are the wrong color. They say our race is inferior, disgusting. Full of crooks, criminals, rapists, evil. There are parts of Tumblr, that make Stormfront look tame. 
>I was a child, and I did not deserve to be harassed, broken down, made afraid. My sisters did not deserve to be attacked and beaten and burned. My cousins did not deserve to be treated the way they were by children who should have welcomed them. We did not deserve this. 
>But we are white. We are white, and for that, we have been told we deserved, as children, who had never hurt a soul, to be beaten, burned, yelled at, degraded, harassed, threatened, attacked, groped, and ostracized. We extended the hand of forgiveness and friendship every time, and we still do. We were, and still are, welcoming, loving, good people. But we were and sometimes still are demonized for our skin color. Told that what happened to us wasn’t racism and wasn’t wrong. 
>It WAS racism. It WAS hatred, and it WAS wrong. They hated us and hurt us because of our race.
>That’s racism, no matter how much you scream and whine and say it isn’t, it can’t be. 
>They hurt us for our race. 
>They were racist. 
>We are white, and we have experienced racism.

>*Female Privilege*
 
 >Hello-kitty-senpai
>Dear (feminist) Tumblr,
>You talk a lot about male privilege, so lets take a moment to look at our privileges as women, shall we?
>Lets list off the things women have in our favor that men don’t:
>- No draft, but we can still vote
>- We get less prison time for the same crime
>- We can rape someone and not be charged (which is fucking disgusting)
>- We can be fairly well assured of being believed when we say we were raped or beaten by a boyfriend/husband
>- We are virtually assured custody of our children in the case of a divorce
>- We are virtually assured that the man who fathered out children will have to continue to pay for that child, even if the child was conceived through deceit 
>- There are laws in place that pretty much assure no consequences for beating our partners
>- We are 4x less likely to commit suicide or have mental health issues
>- Makeup
>- We’re not seen as expendable: given priority in any natural disaster
>- Girls are given more help than boys in school (even though we don’t need it)
>- Better able to get jobs in almost every field
>- help centers for our gender in every single city 
>And many, many more. 
>If you want others to ‘check their privilege’, you had better be willing to check yours as well. 
>Also, no, dears, this isn't “Patriarchy backfiring”, because Patriarchy doesn’t backfire. Patriarchy only benifits men, this is proof against Patriarchy. 
>Welcome to the 1st World, where women have the upper hand and still complain. 
>Lea
 
 *late-nights-and-daydreams*
>No. Actually females are more likely to attempt suicide and to self harm then male counter parts.
and yes we are able to get more jobs because people are still striving for equality. Make up isn’t female privilege. At all. Don’t.
>Al’s being believed if we claim rape? We Also get blamed for the rape. There’s two sides to that.
 
 *hello-kitty-senpai*
>1) Male suicides 3x that of women
>2) women are given more jobs because we are preferred 
>3) makeup is acceptable on women. Men are beaten for wearing it. 
>4) Most people believe rape accusations even in the absence of proof or in the face of evidence to the contrary, its not at all acceptable to victim blame, to the point that even saying that people need to learn self defense just in case is seen as an act of victim blameing. Case in point: Emma Sulkowicz.

>On rape, both male and female
>Dear Tumblr,
>I normally don’t use trigger warnings, because I feel they are largely useless and because a lot of the things people say trigger them are words I use every single day. On this occasion, if on no other, however…TW: discussion of rape.
>As a lot of you know there was a recent media outrage over the case of Columbia University students Emma Sulkowicz and Paul Nungesser. For those who don’t know, the story is as follows: Sulkowicz claims that, during a consensual sexual liaison, Nungesser became suddenly and drastically violent, choking, hitting, and anally penetrating her. She claims he then rolled off of her, put on his clothes without saying a word, and left. 
>When the university found that there was not enough evidence of her side of things for an investigation or charges to be made, Sulkowicz began carrying around the mattress she alleges she was raped on, while Nungesser was barraged with death threats. 
>Recently, however, new evidence has brought every claim she made even more into question than it already was, while simultaneously gathering her staunch, and honestly fanatical support from Radical Feminists. 
>The recent evidence is a log of their Facebook messages, sent between the time after the alleged rape took place and the time when the accusations were first made. The messages are mainly Sulkowicz contacting Nungasser and asking to hang out, have a ‘emma-paul chill sesh' 
>The first message, from two days after she says she was raped in responce to a party invite, is as follows:
>lol yusss
>Also I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz
>because we still haven’t really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr
>On September 9th, she sends another message, asking to hang out. there is a brief conversation, followed by:
>whatever I want to see yoyououoyou
>respond—I’ll get the message on ma phone
>On one occasion, in response to a greeting sent by Nungesser, Sulkowicz sent a message reading “I love you Paul. Where are you?!?!?!?!”
>Friendly communication continued for quite some time before there were rape allegations, apparently out of the blue, followed by coerced testimony from two other girls, one claiming he abused her and the other claiming he tried to force a kiss on her, who later admitted to being told to do it. 
>I want to say, that if Sulkowicz was raped, that’s horrible. 
>However, as unpleasant a light as it may cast on me when I say this, I do not believe she was. When you are raped, it marks you. It leaves you with an overwhelming fear, like a stone in the pit of your belly, like a pressing weight on your shoulders. 
>It does not leave you with the will to carry around the mattress you were raped on, or leave you willing to contact and plan a 'chill sesh’ with your violator. It does not leave you with the urge to party with your attacker or in any fit state of mind to talk to them, or anyone. 
>There are people here who say that…false rape allegations are acceptable, because they 'Bring real victims more visibility’. 
>No, they don’t. They make them less visible, they make people less likely to believe someone who was actually raped. You learned nothing from The Boy Who Cried Wolf and you should be ashamed if you support false rape accusation, you disgusting waste of a human being. 
>“But it’s for The Greater Good!”
>There was once a dark wizard named Grindelwald who imprisoned those who disagreed with him. Above the door to Nurmengard, the prison, Grindelwald carved “For The Greater Good”. 
>The ends do not always justify the means, and in this case, the means do not even create the desired ends, and it cannot be tolerated. 
>In the title I said this would be on male and female rape.
>I feel that we all know about female rape, we all know how horrible it is and we all know about the statistics. However, it’s important that a specific statistic be exposed for the lie that it is: The infamous 1 in 5 statistic. The statistic has been debunked again and again and yet, people still trot it out every time they are questioned. It’s time to let the myth die. If you want things to get better, you have to be honest with the populace. We have to provide better information, we have to make sure victims are taken seriously, and for that to happen, we have to be truthful.
>Do not take this as me bashing victims of sexual assault, because that is not the case. It is downright shameful how victims are treated. Women should not have their sex life examined in the court room. They should not be forced to talk about when/wher/how they lost their virginity, they should not be discarded and dismissed because they are prostitutes or strippers or porn stars. Claims should be looked at objectively, without prejudice towards any party. Victims should be treated with respect.
>On that note, we need to talk about male rape victims. Male rape victims lack what female rape victims have in spades: a support system. Men can be, and often are, assaulted and raped by not only other men but females, as well. This needs to be made more widely known. Men who have been raped deserve to feel safe and to be given access to the same support group settings as female victims. These aren’t 'weak men’, they didn’t ask for it, they didn’t let this happen. They were raped, and they need help. 
>Sincerely, Lea.

>When told that women are given custody more than 95% of the time because of the Tender Years Doctrine written in 1838 by feminist and british uppercrust Caroline Norton, they scoff and roll their eyes, they shout “Liar! LIAR!” at the top of their lungs.

I said it was a bit absurd to claim that every single issue women face is ultimately caused by men.

Article 13 is part of EU copyright legislation; it has been criticized for being so strict that it may inadvertently make certain types of fair use impossible (possibly including some memes, insofar as they are derivative of copyrighted content). But it doesn't have anything to do with censorship in terms of only allowing discourse within a small range of permissible opinions, as Vogel intimates. That's actually pretty clear from the article he cites himself.
Or:

Like what?
> Men have no say in the death of their children
That depends on your views of abortion. If men could get pregnant instead and carry the child and give birth to it, we could talk, but since women and people with uteruses are the ones who do this, they get the final say. Them's the breaks. You can't force someone to carry your child.
> almost always lose custody in court cases
This is false. Upwards of 90% of custody cases are settled out of court without the intervention of a third party. In court cases, joint custody is the default assumption first; primary custody is generally awarded to the person who does the most childcare. This is frequently still the mother.
> are mutilated in their genital areas(which is illegal to do to women)
Almost every feminist in this sub (and elsewhere from what I've seen) is against male circumcision.
>  rape cases where they are victims arent taken seriously
Yes. This is a problem.
> their lives are ruined over false rape accusations
This is less of a problem. Especially if you are rich and famous.
> everyone just assumes men are murderous rapists by nature

So? We didn't eradicate racism when we passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Why would sexism be any different?

This is called the ""fallacy of relative privation."" The existence of bad things elsewhere does not negate the existence of bad things here. Your idea that ""no one seems to focus on that"" is flawed at best. I highly fucking doubt it ""makes you want to cry every day.""

Furthermore, I have no problems with transwomen or using people's preferred pronouns, not that it matters whether I have a problem with it, even if I did. This question is less about my perspective and more about the outlooks of others. Namely, objections to the inclusion of transwomen in women's spaces and the future of lesbianism.
As a sort of secondary note, which I think is necessary given that these topics are somewhat contentious in nature, I recognize that not acknowledging transwomen as being like any other woman, despite their genitalia, contributes to the general transphobic sentiment in society, and that this transphobic sentiment commonly results in violence against trans people, particularly transwomen. I likewise recognize that transwomen are often unfairly accused of licentiousness when they are, to my knowledge, more likely to be victims of sexual violence than to perpetrate it (and, among all women and men, only a small portion engage in violent crime of any sort, anyway).
That said, I sometimes find myself sympathizing with the women dubbed ""TERFs,"" though I don't share their fears at present. I consider that I might feel uncomfortable changing in a room with someone with a penis if I were a woman, even if they were woman-identifying. Naturally, underlying that would be my own prejudice regarding gender, which I think, obviously, is a social construct (as opposed to biological sex, which is a separate concept). Therein lies another related issue, however: the matter of lesbianism and sapphic relations.
How does a lesbian woman who is not attracted to penis reconcile refusing to date transwomen who have a penis? Is not the act of refusing to date transwomen because of their genitalia an admission that they are not ""like regular (cis) women""? It seems to me that lesbians must either accept pre-op transwomen as being like any other (cis) women, and therefore accept dating someone with a penis, or they must make the admission that pre-op transwomen are not ""real"" women because of their penis, and therefore betray their transphobia.
There does not appear to be a medium between the two, as best I can tell. In fact, from my observations, there looks to be a modest rising conflict between these two evidently antithetical notions, pitting some lesbians against the progressive queer or trans movement. So, to reiterate my question on this subject, how do progressive lesbians resolve this conflict for themselves, where it is a conflict?
Thank you.",That's not what TERFs are doing. Trying to degrade all of their hatred and discrimination down to just being uncomfortable with changing near a trans person is insulting.,15,1,1,1

I ask because I don't remember hearing that rhetoric before 2010, but since around then, it's become quite pervasive.
I find it Orwellian, because of how people often refuse to acknowledge how the language is evolving, or discuss whether that's a good thing. They just want to settle everything by cherry-picking one dictionary definition, thereby reducing a complex, ethical issue to a simple, semantic one.
And I've never actually seen a dictionary definition that seems to support this take. Saying that racism must be founded in a sense of superiority (like Google's oft-quoted definition) doesn't get all non-white people off the hook. If you say that, at present, given historical circumstances, white people are uniquely capable of, and almost inevitably inclined toward a specific moral failing called racism, how is that not a way of saying white people are morally inferior? 
Also, I have yet to find a dictionary that doesn't either include a definition of racism that is basically ""racial prejudice"", or list ""racial prejudice"" as a synonym for racism. 
So this idea didn't just come from a dictionary, as a lot of Redditors seem to think. Whose idea was it? Did Martin Luther King think it was impossible to be racist against white people? Did Malcolm X? Pre-hajj? Post-hajj? Nelson Mandela? 
Or am I just that oblivious? Did I just keep missing the memo until my early twenties? Is this something folks used to be afraid to say in front of white people, but now they'll say it from from the safety of the internet? Are we in fact reverting to an earlier definition that was in place before the '90s?
I swear, I'm not especially racist, I just want to know if the world is going crazy or I am.","Your question is quite hard to answer with a sourced comment since it is mostly a rant and spans over multiple ideas and interpretations of the word and concept racism.
Wikipedia gives us a very nifty and very correct definition of racism:

Putting the focus on supremacism or, the belief that one race has attributes that elevates it above others, is one that can mostly only be displayed from a position of power.
The argument ""only white people can be racist"" is a very simplified version of that.
Since colonialism is not that long ago and racism against blacks in modern amercia is, on a timescale, even closer, it is safe to say that the most recent overbearing examples for racism can be found in white culture.
Which is, of course, also linked to the fact that said culture spread itself over the globe via the means of modern globalization and earlier, the aformentioned colonialism.
Following this racism that has actual impact on those who suffer under it came, in recent history, from white people who found themselves in an institutional position of power.
Everyone can be racist, but since white people were and still are mostly in positions of power, their racism is most detrimental to those experiencing it.

I could go on, but you get the picture. 
If we want to tell young girls that they can do whatever they set their minds to, why can't early pregnancy be one of the options? I get that lots of women are forced into being baby carriers by culture and by religion, but this is not true if you live in liberal societies, yet these stereotypes/prejudices continue to persist.
A liberal woman who starts motherhood earlier than 30 is not worth lesser and should not have her with-child status held against her any more than a child bride in a third world country should have her lack of formal education held against her. If the young woman is happy being a young mum, it's *her* choice, people need to get over their need to judge her.","So it's worth pointing out that I don't think this shaming is as universal in ""liberal societies"" (whatever that is supposed to refer to? I'm unclear) as you seem to think. Cultural norms around children/marriage/pregnancy vary a lot, not only between countries but also within them. In the U.S. for instance, both New York and Chicago are both very liberal cities, but they have markedly different economies, geography, costs of living, histories, religious makeup, racial and ethnic demographics, etc. and as such you would expect a lot of cultural norms to be different. 
The other big elephant in the room is race and class and the way they intersect. In general, lower-income people (who in the US are in general more likely to be black or Hispanic) are more likely to have children younger. This means that the stigma around teen pregnancy (or to a lesser extent having a baby before you are established in your career), is associated with being lower class. 
In reality, of course, this is not because there is something wrong with low-income people, but because low-income people tend to have less sex education and less access to reliable reproductive healthcare, including the more expensive but more reliable means of contraception. But classism is a bitch and doesn't really care about logic. 
As you kind of hint at in your ask, this prejudice tends to disproportionately affect women because sexism is also a bitch like that. But in my experience, it's rooted mostly in classism. 
(That said, teen pregnancy specifically tends to lead to worse economic and educational outcomes for girls and for their kids. Girls who get pregnant and decide they want to have the baby should absolutely be supported and shouldn't be shamed, but the way you seem to frame young motherhood, including teen motherhood as empowering is...maybe something you should re-examine? I hope I'm getting the wrong impression there. Teen motherhood is really tough.)",14,1,1,1

**1:** prejudice or discrimination based on sex*especially* **:** discrimination against women **2:** behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.
Let's say Tom likes to cold approach women in public and he thinks that's a good behaviour because he would appreciate being cold approached, can Tom be considered sexist? He's not treating women unfairly, instead he's using the same standards for women and himself - a man. I'm making this example because a lot of women, even in this sub, claim that cold approaching is sexist because it annoys people yet they forget that a lot of men who do this would apppreciate being cold approached by random women, they just treat women like they - men - want to be treated. Tom likes to have sex with as many women as possible and doesn't have high standards since he has a very high libido so he would also like to be approached by a lot of women everywhere, yes I'm depicting the typical PUA.
Let's say Tom is bisexual and goes to a place where most men are gay, Tom begins to cold approach men just like he does with women. I'm making this example because I think that men like Tom would do the same even with men if they were gay, as a matter of fact gay men are much more direct and sexual when it comes to approaching other men from my experience and everyone can see the same trend in gay culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that [gay men are the most promiscuous demographics, while straight people are average and lesbian womenare the least promiscuous demographics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201006/homosexuality-queer-problem).
I'm making this post for another reason too, I think that the typical dating advice ""treat women like normal human beings"" that feminists often give to men doesn't work since many men would like to be cold approached and they definitely think of themselves as human beings. I know that women fear men because they can be dangerous for various reasons like strenght and criminal propensity (men are over-represented in every type of crime) and I think that explaining this gender difference is more helpful than just saying ""treat women equally"" or other variants that put importance on the equality of treatment. Explaining women's issues with safety to men would be more helpful in deterring men from cold approaching women and from my experience is the best argument to convince my male friends and acquaintances from participating in PUA's behavious.
I also think that there are gender differences in sexuality that explain why men and women don't agree on cold approaching, I've explained them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/colxzb/can_the_sexual_objectification_of_women_be_a/) but basically I argue that men are more visual, this means that men are more likely to be aroused by random women while women just notice men without necessarily having a strong sexual response so they are unlikely to see cold approaching favourably. This is not the point that I want to make with this post so you can ignore this last paragraph.","you recognise that perhaps there are gender differences in feelings on being cold approached and that men like it and women don't but the argue its therefore not sexist to cold approach a woman because men like it? do you even know what you're trying to argue?  If women are constantly staating that they/we don't like being cold approached, and men decide 'fuck that, I like it so they must' then yes, you're discriminating against women's decisions and preferences for what happens to them",14,1,1,1

The modern understanding is that it refers to one's gender identity. I think it's fair to say the words ""man"" and ""woman"" has undergone somewhat of a definitional paradigm shift. That is the modern understanding of the words.
The terms ""racism"" and ""sexism"" were coined in sociology to refer to institutional oppression based on race and sex. As such, sociologically speaking, it would be impossible for white men to be the victim of either racism or sexism given that they are not an oppressed group. However, the modern understanding of the words ""racism"" and ""sexism"" refer simply to prejudice based on race and sex respectively. As such, white men *can* be the victims or both racism and sexism. That is the modern understanding of the words.
I've noticed among left-leaning circles such as AskFeminists, people are eager to comply to the new definitions of man and woman yet insist on sticking to the original definitions of racism and sexism. Why is that? Why should our language ""evolve"" in some instances to accommodate how terms are used in modern society yet in other instances, vehemently stick to the original definitions of words?","The terms racism and sexism were not originally coined in sociology, they were both coined by random people. The dictionary definitions of the words are not a theoretical advancement from the sociological definition but just a simplified explanation absent of any sort of theory. The first definition of racism and sexism in the Miriam-Webster dictionary, for example, are both the definitions used when the respective word was first created. Critical theory wasn't even developed until much later than the term racism. So the short answer is we aren't refusing to accept some kind of new understanding of the words, it isn't new",13,0,0,0

From reading the responses to 'talking to strangers in public,' I see a purely anglo-saxon bias towards seeing the world; so I am particularly interested for those of you who do not speak English as your primary language.

 I am suggesting that perhaps there is a 'fear of the other' that feminism truly fails to address adequately, and it is something particularly hard to discern (in terms of psychoanalysis) for this community.  Lets not be unaware of the fact that many of us who do social work are motivated by our own traumatic pasts, and most of the time, we think what we are doing is right because of it. Add to it, a self-congratulatory catalyst that operates like much like other non-self-reflective communities on the internet. We are no different here.  So lets be really conscious of what we write and say.

Yes, of course men, and people in general, should learn to increase their emotional intelligence and ability for consciousnesses when moving about in society. There is no argument here.   
Yet, it takes a particular type of alienation, predominant among principally privileged people who fail to see that capitalism has eroded their social life, unfortunately this particularly affects those women who refuse to acknowledge the social power of 'the feminine mystique.' 

its an unfortunate state of affairs, for both feminist theory and political practice, and  I think, is a key contributor to the bolsenaro's of the world, winning and being voted for. 

i hope feminism can get out of the codified cognitive gutter it has put itself in, but unfortunately, due to a historical lack of theoretical rigor, i dont see this happening. I see the movement as a contributor towards a shitty society rather than trying to make it a better place,  for I see clear resemblances to other types of fear-based one-dimensional rationalizations. 

But this is all assuming that it is an emotional, traumatic response.  I may be completely wrong, so hence the question.","I bet you are *sooooo* interesting.

It's not a novel concept to advocate for equality or justice. For people to be pulled into a movement, there needs to be work put behind it so if self labeled ""egalitarians"" feel they have a just enough cause for action then I'd be willing to see what their plans are and join them. 
As it stands, however, it often seems egalitarianism is used as a rebuttal to feminism, LGBT rights advocacy, and civil rights activism. The people in these movements already are in on the fight and are directing their efforts. I haven't really seen great examples of egalitarians doing the same.
People I've met who self-label as egalitarian don't seem to have that fire and I kind of condemn them for not putting their money where their mouth is. If you see injustice and are not putting the work in to fight it then what are you asking of others? Claims of things being hard or people fighting against you doesn't really cut it for me because a lot of activism is putting yourself in danger, slogging through emotionally trying and difficult situations, or tolerating insufferable things just to maybe get a little of what you want done.

I am looking for advice and possibly some source feminist reading material from this group. I would like to find sources to refer to so that I can be more informed when it comes to conversations about the historical contributions of women. For context, I am a demi-bisexual woman getting a Ph.D. in a male-dominated field in STEM. Yesterday I was having a conversation with a male friend of mine from college.  He is an educated ex-marine, and I think fairly progressively in his beliefs. I told him that I enjoyed having female friends more than male friends because my female friends have historically been more supportive of me than male friends. I also admitted that I do have a few male friends, but overall I don't enjoy the ""every man for himself"" mentality I have encountered among male friendships. Men tend to bond through competition. Women tend to bond through conversation. I remember learning this concept in my gender studies class in undergrad. Is it possible I learned it incorrectly? He told me that my statements were problematic because men have historically worked together beautifully and are just as supportive as women if not in different ways. I was a bit surprised that he would say this. He said that I was more or less ""making stuff up"" based on my personal bias, but I was thinking about how women have historically been assigned a role in the home to support and raise families while men have been given positions of power.  I was unsure about how to approach the conversation. Does anyone have any reading material I could look at to have more informed conversations about gender dynamics and the supportive role that women have historically played in our society?

How might I have this conversation constructively?","Some books that I would recommend:
* *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center* by bell hooks
   * This book covers a wide range and functions as an introduction. 
      * It benefits by giving a clear and quotable definition of Feminism: as the Movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.
      * It critiques some earlier feminist thinking and where it went wrong. Mainly the white liberal feminism that didn't notice the existence of Women of color in the workforce.
      * It covers how men are and can also be victims to sexist oppression.
* *Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics* by bell hooks
   * Another introductory book by hooks.
      * This book covers a wider range of topics while the previous looked at the feminist movement and how it could benefit from starting at the margins of society instead of being centered on white women, that a white women feminism is victim to white supremacy.
      * This book covers such things as Politics, Education, Class Struggle, Global Feminism, Reproductive Rights, Marriage, Feminist Parenting, Feminist Masculinity, and more
      * This book and the previous help to show the reader how the perception of Feminism was shaped by our patriarchal media system. This is not a conspiracy theory; rather, the media was able to choose Feminist idols that were visible and easy to tear down as wacky.
* *The Essential Feminist Reader* by Estelle B. Freedman
   * This is a collection of works organized chronologically by Freedman
      * You wanted something that would show the historical presence of women, and this book can do that. 
      * The earliest document in this book comes from Christine De Pizan, France, 1405. Although, most of its documents come from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
      * This book is not just European and American, it includes sources from India, China, Mexico, Zimbabwe and more.
      * The entries are all rather short, and some are more philosophical and other are more literary. 
      * I have only read selections out of it, so I don't know how helpful it would be in specific situations of conflict.
These are all simple books I'd recommend. One book that I'm not recommending because I never see it quoted and I believe it may be sort of out of date is *Women's Choices: Philosophical Problems Facing Feminism* by Mary Midgley and Judith Hughes. The reason, however, why I bring it up is that the authors said something that has stuck with me. When they were writing the book, pre-1983, the feminist movement, as they saw it, has a strange relation with history. As the authors say, 
>Many members of the current women's movement, including some of its prophets, have recorded that when they began their work they thought they were breaking entirely new ground. They did not know they had predecessors at all, and were often delighted to discover them. (pg. 121)
Be delighted to find them, and unlike the authors, for they continue in negative manner from this, make them common knowledge. And as common knowledge as something we can call upon immediately instead of having to search for. Hope this helps.",4,1,1,1

That said, online, I avoid participating in discussions of gender and race because I am a white man, and so I don't feel my perspectives on the issues will be received well. I never comment on other peoples' threads or posts with whataboutism (I think there is room in activism for every issue), and I don't invalidate peoples' lived experiences.
That said, I sometimes see posts saying things along the lines of, for example, men don't have to worry about walking alone at night or the more common, men worry about women rejecting them and women worry about men killing them. There is a grain of truth to these, I'd argue, but they're still just generalizations. Men are the majority of victims of violence other than sexual violence (and most perpetrators are men), so with that knowledge, I actually do worry about being attacked when I am out at night or somewhere remote alone. Having been abused and stalked and harassed by women I've dated or separated from in the past, I also worry about more than being rejected. In fact, rejection isn't even something I ever worried much about, as I've rarely been one to approach women first.
Of course, these are circumstantial to me. Nevertheless, it feels difficult and even daunting to participate in online discussions because there seems to be a lot of bias promoting the idea that men have little to fear from others or that we are not fearful for our safety, and for me, that's simply not the case. Beyond that, if I see a woman presenting an argument online using a fact or piece of information that I know is inaccurate because I am familiar with the scholarly literature surrounding the issue, I feel compelled to rebut it on occasion, but I never do because I fear that it might come across as what people call mansplaining. I never discuss race issues at all because I don't think my opinion on them is valuable, outside of the most basic of things such as rejecting racist ideas being propagated by racists.
So, as the title implies, my question is, generally: what is the appropriate way for a white man to participate in debates related to gender and race issues online? Is it worthwhile to rebut incorrect statements with counter-evidence presented in a public space, or is it best to leave these discussions to women and non-white academics?
Thank you!","Instead I ask you this:
Why do you feel the need to correct people speaking in generalizations to point out a flaw in culture?
Men's culture is harming women, it is. Whether it's physically, mentally, or emotionally. Why do you feel the need to nitpick someone talking about it?
And it is nitpicking, because men are victims of other violence-- but you're completely ignoring the fact that ""other violence"" is done by men as well. 
Women are hurt, the most, by men.
Men are hurt, the most, by other men.
I don't think you can claim to be arguing in good faith when  you're ignoring that fact.
No one is saying men dont have issues, or are not fearful. They just aren't as much, in the same way, or to the greatest scale as women-- women's entire being involves keeping themselves safe in a way that men aren't. Instead of looking to argue, actually listen to what they're saying.",4,0,0,0

Let's look at the definition of sexism
**1:** prejudice or discrimination based on sex*especially* **:** discrimination against women **2:** behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.
Let's say Tom likes to cold approach women in public and he thinks that's a good behaviour because  he would appreciate being cold approached, can Tom be considered sexist?  He's not treating women unfairly, instead he's using the same standards for women and himself - a man.  I'm making this example because a lot of women, even in this sub, claim that cold approaching is sexist because it annoys people yet they forget that a lot of men who do this would apppreciate being cold approached by random women, they just treat women how they would like to be treated. Tom likes to have sex with as many women as possible and doesn't have high standards since he has a very high libido so he would also like to be approached by a lot of women everywhere, yes I'm depicting the typical PUA.
Let's say Tom is bisexual and goes to a place where most men are gay,  Tom begins to cold approach men just like he does with women.  I'm making this example because I think that  men like Tom would do the same even with men if they were gay, as a matter of fact gay men are much more direct and sexual when it comes to approaching other men from my experience and everyone can see the same trend in gay culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that [gay men are the most promiscuous demographics, while straight people are average  and lesbian womenare the least promiscuous demographics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201006/homosexuality-queer-problem). 
I'm making this post for another reason too, I think that the typical  dating advice ""treat women like normal human beings"" that feminist often give to men doesn't work since many men would like to be cold approached and they definitely think of themselves as human beings.  I know that women fear men because they can be dangerous for various reasons like strenght and criminal propensity (men are over-represented in every type of crime and their main victims are other men) and I think that explaining this gender difference is more helpful than just saying ""treat women equally"" or other variants that put importance on the equality of treatment. Explaining women's issues with safety to men would more helpful in deterring men from cold approaching women and from my experience is the best argument  to convince my male friends acquaintances from participating in PUA's behavious.
I also think that there are gender differences in sexuality  that explain why men and women don't agree on cold approaching, I've explained them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/colxzb/can_the_sexual_objectification_of_women_be_a/) but basically I argue that men are more visual , it means that men are more likely to be aroused by random women while women just notice men without  necessarily having a strong sexual response so they're unlikey to see cold approaching favourably.  This is not the point that I want to make with this post so you can ignore this last paragraph.","Oh shit y'all, he brought the dictionary. Sorry, not trying to be snarky but... seriously? You're in a feminism sub and you thought the best way to start your post is by copy/pasting the first hit when you type in ""sexism"" on google? 
Despite the fact that this is pretty clearly a ""gotcha, feminists!"" ask, I'll try to answer your question. 
Staggering misunderstandings of queer culture aside, it's not sexist to approach women in public, make conversation, and introduce yourself. The thing is though, most of the time, the way y'all do it is super sexist. 
Some things to keep in mind when doing this: 
Women do not owe you their attention. Or even their politeness. If she doesnt give it to you, nothing has been deprived from you. 
Give her an ""out."" I remember men who have said things like ""I don't mean to make this too personal, but do you have a boyfriend?"" Or ""If you have somewhere to be, please don't let me keep you""  (not in a passive aggressive way) fondly, because they're giving me a chance at a graceful exit by acknowledging that I might not want to or be able to talk to them. 
Learn to read body language. She probably doesn't want to talk to you, straight up. Think about how you would feel if you were approached by some random dude in public. Learn to excuse yourself and duck out after she clearly isnt into it.
Treat her like a human being. This post kind of makes you seem like you have a chip on your shoulder about women who complain about street harassment. Not a good look. Have some empathy. 
The reality is, though, even if you're awesome, many women have just experienced a lot of street harrassment, and for a lot of us, the handsomest guy would come up to us and be incredibly polite and we would *still* feel a little put off/on the spot/uncomfortable. The thing with cold approaching is you're almost certainly gonna creep some people out, and almost certainly gonna experience rejection, probably not too nicely either. I'd stick with trying to build up acquaintanceships with girls you meet parties, through friends, ect, and asking them out after yall have had some sparks.",3,1,1,1

It's a really unnecessary and divisive term.
I understand it's a somewhat useful term when talking about electoral politics and election statistics, but if you're gonna use that phrase, you should also use ""black working class"", ""black middle class"", ""Hispanic middle class"" etc. Only using the phrase ""white working class"" makes it seem like minorities don't work or the labor work of minorities is less valuable than that of whites, that all minorities are poor or working class, or that massive wealth disparities don't exist within minority populations (example: East Asian-Americans vs Southeast Asian-Americans, Cuban-Americans vs Mexican-Americans, etc.).
There's also this weird notion by some people that working class whites are uniquely racist and socially backward (apparanty racism doesn't among middle class whites and rich whites). I won't deny that racial prejudice played a significant role in the election of Donald Trump, but numerically, most working class whites didn't even vote for Trump. Most either didn't vote at all, voted for Hillary, or voted third party. Trump won by the skin of his teeth due to a few thousand votes in 4 key swing states. You can thank our shitty outdated as fuck electoral college for that.
But this odd notion that trying to appeal to working class whites *at all*, even with a purely economic *nonracist* message, is itself appealing to racism. Not only does this unfairly generalize an entire voting demographic as being intrinsically racist, it also ignores recent elections. Democrat Andy Beshear won the governership in *Kentucky*, a state that's *86% white* and overwhelmingly working class and poor. Beshear won by appealing to basic economic and material concerns, and he did without any racist pandering. It also ignores the fact that during the 2016 primaries Bernie Sanders won several states that are rural and predominantly white and poor/working class, most notably West Virginia which is *96% white% and even poorer than Kentucky.
Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang have managed to attract a sizeable following of white working class voters and former Trump voters. One crucial message that Sanders, Warren, and Yang (*especially* Yang) keep repeatedly telling these voters is this: immigrants aren't taking your jobs, it's automation and big corporations that are taking your jobs. Immigrants are not your enemy. This message has resonated with many of these voters. It shows that many working class whites are beginning to realize that they've been duped by decades of Republican propaganda that fooled them into believing immigrants and minorities are the real enemy, not the rich and powerful. 
If Democrats hammer away on a powerful economic message that appeals to people of all races and backgrounds, they're gonna curb stomp Trump's head in half in 2020.

>You are absolutely correct. So let's move past our fixation on physical and sexual violence and take a look at emotional violence and the internalization of gender roles. As I've noted elsewhere, it is curious how when men internalize their assigned gender to the point where it becomes harmful to themselves and those around them, it's ""toxic masculinity"", but when women internalize their assigned gender to the point where it becomes harmful to themselves and those around them, it's ""internalized misogyny"".

>*TORONTO -- The age-old bias that suggests “boys don’t cry” is unconsciously perpetuated by mothers more than fathers, according to new research from the University of Guelph.*
>*The study, published in the Canadian Journal of Behavioral Science, found that moms tend to favour girls expressing emotions of sadness and anger over boys. Fathers, on the other hand, lacked a bias towards emotions of anger and sadness in their children.*
>The researchers say they were surprised by this finding, which is odd because this meta-analysis of several different studies on the topic found the exact same thing, and it was published in 1998.
>Beauty standards specifically are not as widely studied, but eating disorders are, and we find that the attitudes of mothers are better predictors than the attitudes of fathers.

>Most child abusers are women, based on CPS estimates that are primarily concerned with physical and sexual abuse. Female abusers are far more likely to use emotional violence, which is far less likely to be reported, taken seriously, or even perceived as abuse by the victim. I didn't realize my mother was emotionally abusive until I was 26 and had been hospitalized multiple times for symptoms none of the doctors recognized as being consistent with CPTSD and a history of emotional abuse and neglect. Tellingly, I realized it after reading a book that was written by and for female victims of male abusers.

After all, they're our mothers. We're supposed to love them unconditionally for everything they did for us and look past their faults and abuses. Our fathers who slaved away at a job they hated for twenty years in order to give us a better life are somehow not owed the same understanding and gratitude.

>You're backtracking from your original claim that emotional violence is just as or more potent a weapon than physical violence. To the extent that men are more physically violent, I would note that ""boys will be boys"" - a sentiment I have only ever heard expressed by women - cuts both ways. Boys are allowed (by their predominately female caretakers) to get away with things girls are not allowed to get away with, but they are also expected to fend and stand up for themselves in a way that girls are not. When authority won't help, boys on the playground learn that violence is sometimes the only way to ensure their safety and emotional well-being. That doesn't justify their violence as adults - especially violence in intimate relationships - but that brings us back to the original question of agency in the internalization of gender roles.

Honestly answering this question re-quires tracing the history of both the theory and practice of domestic violence law. Undertaking such an exploration, one quickly finds that the “discovery” of domestic violence is rooted in the essential feminist tenet that society is controlled by an all-encompassing patriarchal structure.8 This fundamental feminist understanding of domestic violence has far-reaching implications. By dismissing the possibility of female violence, the framework of legal programs and social norms is narrowly shaped to respond only to the male abuse of women. Fe-male batterers cannot be recognized. Male victims cannot be treated. If we are to truly address the phenomenon of domestic violence, the legal response to domestic violence and the biases which underlie it must be challenged.*

This isn't even getting into how banks were using race-based predatory loans then defaulting on them:

So this goes a long way towards explaining the lowering of property values. Heck whites were convinced by these same lenders to leave in the first place: https://medium.com/@DmitriMehlhorn/a-requiem-for-blockbusting-68152244e77a
So it's not like blacks could even have the same option of leaving. Large numbers of poor black families live in hyper-segregated neighborhoods with limited access to opportunity.
As for crime rates blacks are increased for the same crimes whites do, but while the later goes free the former gets overly harsh sentences:

Notice how blacks are searched more often yet few weapons are found on them, while it is the reverse for whites?
That’s because not all criminal activity is reported and not all laws are applied equally. Police departments already disproportionately police and surveil poor communities and communities of color.
Certain communities, often white and middle-class, that place greater trust in police departments are more likely to report crimes and Black communities are more likely to be reported as suspected of committing crimes. 
Hell white kids avoid discipline and suspension, while minorities don't! And it isn't because minorities are evil: 
https://www.pnas.org/content/116/17/8255 
https://supportiveschooldiscipline.org/learn/reference-guides/discipline-disparities
We only know about reported and solved crimes, and the bias in favor of white victims of black people is there. Poor, black victims are not generating as much interest, which is known and pretty much incontroversial.
Then there are the cops actively supporting the racists as well: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/police-white-nationalists-racist-violence

There are many ways the crime stats could be skewed.

Even in suicidal situations like at gun point?","I was watching The Last Kingdom. In the series the King Alfred of Wessex, Britain's most powerful region, literally believes all pagans are weaklings because they don't believe in the true God and Christians are stronger and more disciplined by default. The protagonist of the series,Uthred, is a worshipper of Viking gods and was hired as a mercenary by Alfred's generals. When Alfred first discovered the fact he wanted to expel Uhtred simply for being pagan because he believes pagans are not capable of fighting well (despite facing defeats by the Norse invaders so many times). Eventually Uhtred as defeats the Norse invaders multiple times after being given an army by one of Alfred's generals. But despite this Alfred still plots on expelling Uhtred because he literally believes Uhtred is a weakling who can't lead armies in war all because he is a pagan and eventually Alfred gains the belief Britain will fall because the commander is a weakling (and all because the commander is pagan). So at one meeting Uhtred finally loses it and manages to close in on Alfred and put a knife to the king's throat. Alfred literally boasts to Uhtred that Uhtred cannot kill him because Uhtred is a pagan and Alfred is not only king but a devout Christian. Literally Alfred believed he was immune to getting his throat slashed all because he is a devout Christian and Uhtred a heathen. Uhtred has enough self control to use the king as hostage and escape rather than killing Alfred on the spot after being treated like a second class citizen for years despite his loyalty.
I bring up this fictional example because I notice sadly irl not only is this level of prejudice and believing stereotypes so blindly like every member of a certain group like Trekkies are all skinny weaklings or black people are all muscular athletes, but people will even continue believing this stereotype and treat member of said group under the assumption they fit the stereotype (even if said member obviously does not fit the stereotype at all such as a Jew wearing rags of clothes with holes because he is too poor or an Arab wearing not just Western clothes but even wearing a Roman Catholic Crucifix as a necklace). 
An irl example is Pancho Villa. While a lot of people know about Pancho Villa's infamous story of killing a landlord (often described as a white Mexican in most tellings) for raping his sister and scarring her face afterwards, what is often overlooked is that Pancho Villa already had violent tendencies prior to the incident. The landlord who raped his sister? That was not the first time he mistreated Pancho. Years before the incident Pancho punched a relative of that same landlord because he called his mom a whore. Months prior to the rape, the landlord came swaggering into his estate and started robbing Pancho's hard worked food produce he grew. Pancho got mad and picked up a broom stick (or mallet or other object depending on the source) and whacked the landlord and only a priest's intervention stopped the whole thing and protected Pancho from later legal repercussion.
Yet despite experiencing how violent Pancho was firsthand, this landlord would later rape his sister and he literally believed Pancho will do nothing to hurt the landlord. Because Pancho was a peon and the landlord believed all the stereotypes of peons, that they were not just uneducated but very very stupid and lacking in common sense and in addition all peons are mentally fragile weaklings and to boot cowards of the utmost level. Sources say the landlord was really legitimately surprised Pancho appeared at his villa hours after he learned of his sister's rape with a pistol and was aiming his gun. Some records say the landlord even boasted at Pancho that despite having a gun, Pancho will not shoot the landlord because he is too cowardly and stupid because he is a peon. Well guess who got shot multiple times?
IRL I seen this insane belief so stereotyping go far beyond typical sensitive identities like the black race, the Jewish religion, aristocrats, etc but even towards groups defined by hobbies esp subcultures revolving around them like the otaku culture. I cannot tell you how much if you say rap is your favorite music, I seen people steer clear of you because they think you are associated with criminals (even though you are wearing a tuxedo and speak with a very eloquent voice using big words used a lot at college level classes and university debates). Or people assume you are a manchild because you play video games as a side hobby despite the fact you are a muscular jock who spends almost all his time lifting weights and running in preparation for football season.
Why is this? I get if say you are a skinny nerd wearing glasses like the stereotypical Trekkie fan that people would assume you fit the stereotypes of the Trekkie fandom like being physically weak and socially awkward. But if you are obese and out of shape, people shouldn't assume you will do well at basketball (sadly I wish I was making this up but I seen this happen during the selections for sports team in high school and middle school).
Why do people think this way? Stereotypes may have some truth but why do people suddenly turn off their common sense and assume if you are Asian you are a physically frail wimp (even though you are 6'6 and have the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger)?  Or that just because you have a Spanish name you are an illiterate  punk Mexican despite you having white skin and speaking with the vocabulary of a college professor?
How come people rely on stereotypes so much to the point of suicide like trying to bully around and beat up an Otaku who happens  to be a quarterback in top shape simply because he's into the anime/manga subculture (known to attract obese weirdos) and ignoring how obviously fit his body is? Why does common sense seemed to be turned off so much in exchange for believing stereotypes literally, that it applies to everyone to x group?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Would be good to clear things up and know what the sub thinks about the topic.  
Apart from bias, which is the most reprehensible reason and is the one the societal culture's perception of women needs working on, there's also the reason that women in general have more interests that go in line with jobs in the lower- paying end. Like the previous one, this also is being worked on, with an effort to get girls to be interested in STEM more. But other reasons that come to play are women in general would rather receive additional benefits than pay raises and the issue of having kids is more of a burden for women than men (but I believe this is more of a personal choice, you can argue that society could put in more consideration for women because they have more burden of expectations on having kids but I think that having kids is completely optional and that there's a progress in the culture that shares domestic responsibilities).",[removed],1,0,0,0

I too subscribe to the idea that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum and is not by itself ""controlling"" and shaping every one from the every-day user to the CEO of techno-corporations.
Where I've been confused, though, is whether I've missed a point if I, *at times*, just focus on what the technology ""does"" to the user. I realize that a company creates the technology and the user uses the technology so whatever the media ""does"" to the user, is by extension, the company doing something to the user. But, with that in mind, is it academically or intellectually unsound to occasionally just focus on the technology 🡢user and user 🡢 technology dynamic?
During my studies, I have written plenty of papers about technology with topics such as:
1. Clickbait and Fake News \[where I am critical of how news outlets use specific social media tools to 'disguise' the truth\]
2. Bias in coding \[where I am critical of coders and code being neutral. Even in seemingly 'neutral' things like childrens apps\]
3. Difference between eBooks and paper books \[where I am *only* analyzing how the ebook changes the way people read in certain situations\]
4. How the online forums and message boards can impact the social life people who live in isolated, rural areas \[how subcultures such as underground punk rock can now reach a isolated rural areas because of internet message boards\]
Now, 1 and 2 on that list take on the idea of power structures, politics and the companies and people who are building these technologies as well as how these companies with or without them knowing it, are ""shaping"" society through their technology in certain ways.
In the papers 3 and 4 on that list, I only looked to analyze the specific technology and its affordances from a user standpoint. My use of an eBook reader the last 10 years has definitely shaped the way I read books. For example, if I go on a vacation, I can now bring hundreds of digital books without it taking up more space in my suitcase. That means that the eBook reader changes the way I  go on vacation. It might even change the way I experience a foreign country, because now I can bring 20 different history books about the place I am visiting instead of just one book. Or maybe, on the other hand, because I have so much reading material, I tend to stay more in bed in the hotel room rather than actually explore the place I'm visiting.
Now, I *could* have also written about how eBook-retailers are changing the book economy or how user data is collected by the companies in order to get me to read certain authors or buy certain books. But the fact was that I usually had a limit of 20-25 pages to write and I found it interesting how this new medium changed the way took in literature.
I do understand the problem with saying, in a general way, ""technology shapes us and it shapes society"", because of course economic, social and power structures are intrinsically built into technology by the people creating these technologies, whether it be a huge multinational corporation or a non-profit coder on GitHub releasing her software for free. But is there also a place for *just* analyzing what technology does to me while avoiding the trap of technological determinism? I would say that there definitely are places where the larger political power structures are less important to an analysis. For example:
While being bedridden a while back, I spent a lot of time on Instagram and I found an old friend. I started following his profile and his daily updates where he was out in the wild nature (walking in forests, hiking in mountains, etc.)
This person's Instagram profile changed my plans for after my rehab. I had planned to start swimming daily at the local indoor pool, but because I saw so many pictures and videos of incredible locations in nature, I started planning daily hiking trips instead of swimming. Seeing pictures of nature daily simply reminded me how much I enjoy being in nature.
I know that me viewing this friend's profile made me part of an advanced algorithm on Instagram and my activity and the way I used the app all relates back to the designers, coders and company politics of Instagram, but if I had to write a paper on ""How does viewing nature profiles on Instagram affect rehab patients"", then I personally think that the fact that I was exposed and in which ways I was exposed to nature imagery, would be more interesting to explore than the political / power structures of Instagram. The fact that I was able to ask my friend in a comment ""where is this place?"" or the fact that I could re-watch the videos again and again made the experience different than watching a TV show about nature for example.
I have taken classes over the years that have tended to be more deterministic such as ""User interaction in online communities"" and less deterministic such as ""Bias and privacy concerns in digital coding"". I feel like I've learned a lot from both of these perspectives.

Not including homosexuals, men only judge other men on their character and not on their sexual attraction. Of course subconsciously, objective standards of positive physical attributes (e.g. symmetrical face) can bias a mans opinion of another man, most of it is to do with the mans character and use in a society.
Social media has allowed women to be at the forefront of choosing a dating partner without the input of other men. They can 'window-shop' and judge a man solely by how he presents and perceives himself compared to how other men perceive him. Before women would observe how a man fit in with other men (e.g. how dominant they were, how competent they were compared to their peers) and select the men based on this.
However women are biased by their sexual attraction to males, which influences how she perceives the mans character i.e. more physically attractive to women means better character subconsciously during first impressions.
Of course after dating for a period of time she can better judge a mans character but other things get in the way. They become infatuated by the man due to the chemicals released during sex (nowadays sex ofter happens very early in the relationship not after marriage when the woman could better judge the man she was dating without the hormones released during sex) and this in turn means that they are more biased.
Men with positive character traits who are physically unattractive cannot get their foot through the door (if women were to solely use online dating which I know is not true but it is increasingly popular) and therefore they are becoming excluded from dating.",Your post history leads me to believe your participation here is in less than good faith.
