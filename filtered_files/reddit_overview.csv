Would you be comfortable transporting an ESA from the airport? What would make you more inclined to?,"I realize that Lyft drivers are not required to transport non-service dogs but I wanted to get a feel for how likely I am to find a driver willing to pick me and my dog up from the airport.
I have a 75-ish pound ESA for a valid and diagnosed disability. He is a breed that sheds some, but I bathe and groom him before the flight. He is highly obedience trained and a service dog in training (SDiT) but isn't solid enough on tasks to claim him as a service dog yet. tl;Dr: he sleeps in the car, is clean and well behaved.
What would make you more likely to take the fare? I know to call immediately after getting matched with a driver and letting them know my situation - would offering them a good tip for their trouble help? I also know the driver has the right to say no, just trying to maximize my chances!

Newly Activated and have questions!,"Hi everyone Im 20 years old and just got activated for Uber eats. I have done door dash and postmates prior but got deactivated from doordash year or so ago because of a hot head customer falsely accusing me of something that never happened because his food wasn’t “hot enough” because he lived 20 min away. Postmates is just a waste it feels like and virtually no orders. And I wasn’t able to get reactivated with doordash, because there customer service is trash. Im not expecting to make a completely livable income of course, but just something to pay the bills, doing independent contract deliveries are perfect for my situation as I have a medical condition I’ve been dealing with for the last few years which causes chronic pain so working a “normal” 9-5 is pretty difficult. Although , So far Uber eats customer support has been great and very helpful in getting me activated, it did take about a week and a half to get activated but was due to COVID-19 and also insurance verification issues. But I had a few questions ! • How much do you generally make per week with Uber eats? •Do I not need a prepaid card when I go to make deliveries? Other food delivery apps I always needed a bag and card so little confused. •What are the requirements needed to stay a Uber eats driver? Rating? Acceptance rate? •Fee for instant pay? •Average delivery pay per delivery? •How long do tips generally take to show up? Do people tip a lot usually? If there is anything else important I should know please let me know, Thank you! Otherwise, Glad to be a part of the subreddit and UberEats !","It’s hard to answer most of those questions because it all depends on the area you deliver in. I’ve seen people make $1000+ a week and others hardly make anything. Your own motivation is also a big factor. You’ll see a lot of lazy drivers complaining on here. Base pay depends on you area and current promotions going on (if your area has those), and distance. Instant cash out is $0.50 unless you use the GoBank debit card which is what I have. Tips usually arrive within an hour delivery because I believe the customer can change the tip after the order has been dropped off. I usually always get a tip and hardly ever get no tippers anymore.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/g1wtzv/newly_activated_and_have_questions/,UberEATS,"""medical condition""|""medical issue""",g1wtzv,2020-04-15,0,3,Justonfire_,1,,both,1,"motivation; positive: customer support has been great/helpful

Deactivated because they say my verification photo isn't me. It is me.,"Has anyone had this happen? It's totally unfair. I probably didn't look like the photo because my hair is half in my face and my skin color is darker as the lighting is different--outdoors and not indoors, as I waited in my car to start working. Now that I already submitted one photo they won't even let me try to take a different one and compare the three and see that it's the same person. Absolutely no offer of a fix for this. (Then why ask me to contact support if this is an error???) I even took one like 1 month ago and was probably wearing the same jacket as I am in my profile picture so they approved it no problem... which isn't fair either. Because I'm wearing a t-shirt now and my face was half blocked it probably declined my photo.
The profile photo is like over 6 months old and I haven't cut my hair so it's much longer. They should be able to see it's the same style though, which is a pretty unique bushy hairstyle. No one has even said my ID photo isn't me and it's from over 10 years ago and I was super thin compared to now.
But the main reason this isn't fair is because I could go to a greenlight location and show that this is me, prove my identity, and even take a picture right in front of them and show them how I might look different on an iPhone picture versus in person, if that even matters. Their email says ""the decision is final"" which makes me think going to a greenlight location, I'd just be laughed out of there.
I know that these rideshare apps don't give drivers a fair chance and even a second chance after deactivating us. That's one of the reasons why so many people on the subreddits here for Uber and Lyft are so pissed off and act like they hate the job. There's a way to prevent that though--if they just made better choices about how to handle misunderstandings as simple as this! It's such an easy fix. I did nothing wrong! What, if I got a new haircut I would be deactivated??? That doesn't make any sense! How do they handle drivers getting a short haircut suddenly? Or their hair growing? Or wearing makeup vs. not wearing makeup?
I've been doing Uber for over a year and a half and getting good feedback and never had a problem. For some people this is the most feasible source of at least some income because they either can't work a scheduled job or they need experience when they haven't worked many jobs in life yet. Or for disabled people, which they seem to be super supportive of when it comes to riders, but what about the drivers? (I have a disability as well.)
Something needs to change about the way they handle deactivations, at least for the photo verification. There's a reason they say ""If this is a mistake, contact support"" when they decide to deactivate your account over the verification photo. At least let me send a second photo!!!
I'm willing to full-on go outside, take a video of my face in the car that looks like the ""not me"" photo I took, then go inside, put on foundation on-video, and make the lighting look the same as the account picture live, so they can see I don't have a twin.
Also, I have unique characteristics, like I'm missing eyelashes on the eye that is showing. I could zoom into the photo and show the amount of eyelashes I have on that one and the amount of eyelashes I have in person. I look literally identical to the picture. The reason it's been rejected is because of an old picture vs. a new one and lighting/angle/whatever. This is crazy.",That’s really odd. I make funny faces and have my middle finger in front of my face every time those pop up and it’s never given me any issues. Of course they only pop up when there’s a nice surge and I’m on the off ramp going into the surge zone so that’s why it makes me angry.

Why do Doordashers refuse to bring the food to my door?,"I've used Grubhub, Postmates, and Caviar and never once had this problem. I'm disabled and put very detailed instructions on exactly where to park. In my three Doordash orders one demanded more money to come up (I had already tipped $5) and another literally lied to me about there being no parking as I looked out my building window and saw her sitting in an empty spot after I asked nicely if she could bring it up because I'm disabled. A third gave me a hard time but eventually came up. This is astonishingly bad service. Each time it seemed like the dasher didn't even read my note. And the guy that demanded more money seemed to be unaware that I had already tipped. Do Dashers not see the note and/or tip?

What's the point of pretending you delivered my food?,"Weird situation for me, a frequent PM customer due to disability. Anyway, I ordered some late lunch today at about 4pm. The order was allegedly accepted and 'on the way' almost immediately. About five minutes later I got an incoming call from some number I'd never seen before, located in Montana. (I'm in NYC.) Ignored it because I'm inundated with spam calls from unknown numbers. Happened twice more. (In retrospect I realize I should've answered just in case, but I've never received a call from a Postmate before--only texts--so didn't think it was related.) The app map thingy showed the delivery-person icon as riding (on a bike) slowly toward me--but, unusually, the driver's name never showed up in the app. I've never seen this before. The delivery ETA started as 4:20, then inched up to 4:48 as time passed. Still no delivery ID.
At 4:50 I received a text saying that (delivery person's first name) would arrive in a few minutes. I checked the app and yep, the person's name had finally showed up. Next I got the ""your food has arrived! Contact driver to get your food"" message. Please note: I live in a regular apartment building with a doorman, no weird gates or multiple building complexes or other obstacles to getting the delivery directly to me. Every other PM just bops over to my doorman and then gets sent up to my door.
So I waited by my door but no one showed up for about 5 minutes--then I glanced at the app and saw that the ""Add a tip!"" popup was already showing, the driver apparently having marked the order as delivered. Which, obviously, was not the case. I waited a little longer and then said fuck it, this whole thing is hinky.
All this long-ass storytelling is to get to the question: WHY? I assume he just ate the order himself or God only knows what. But what's the point? Did he think I'd just write it off and not report the issue? (Which I did, and got my instant credit, thank you very much PM service!) But doesn't that cause some kinda mark on the driver's record? Or at least he'd be the one out-of-pocket. So why risk that? Was the dude just super-hungry, and if so, why bother schlepping all the way to my apartment before scarfing my food?
If the doorman wasn't there for some reason (extremely unlikely) and the driver really really needed me to come down--problematic for me due to the disability issue, but not impossible--then why not just text me?! If he was stuck in traffic or unable to leave his bike... again, why not text me? I don't get it.
At this point it's academic; I've been refunded, so whatevs. But I'm genuinely curious! So help a gal out, please. What's the likely scenario here?","I have to wonder if they didn’t just obliviously deliver it to the wrong person.

What is it that has some shoppers so angry?,"I have read several posts by shoppers who seem angry that people pay to have their shopping done. Posts that make exclamations about 'luxury' and 'privilege' some with very demeaning comments referring to Instacart customers.
Are people not aware that many people use Instacart out of necessity? Even if a person is using it as a luxury service, where is the anger coming from? As a shopper do you not want people to pay for the service that generates your income?
I am not going to lie... reading these comments makes me wonder how many shoppers feel this way. Do the kind, upbeat, amazing shoppers that deliver to me secretly hate me?
I am disabled and at the time I started using the service I was struggling so hard to do my shopping and I was more than a little nervous as I didn't know what I was going to do as my disability has gotten progressively worse. Without Instacart I am not sure how I would get my groceries. I have everything come in from Instacart, Amazon and a pharmacy delivery service AND I feel so fortunate to be alive at a time when these services exist.
To all of you who work in any service industry in any capacity, me and others like me appreciate you more than you can ever know. Until you are in a situation where you have to rely on others to do things for you that the majority of people can do... like jump in the car or take a walk down the street for a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk.. it's hard to really understand how important service work is and how those who take care and pride in what they do really mean so much. On the opposite side, I have had orders where things are past expiration, moldy, crushed or missing... A refund doesn't cut it when I have no way to get the items myself and on bad days when I get a shopper who just doesn't seem to care, I just want to cry because I am so dependent on this service and it makes it so glaringly obvious how bad of a situation I am in... thankfully most of the time it's a really good experience.. but now I am rambling. I guess I just don't get all the anger and the hate.

What happens when you complain about a postmate driver?,"Hi there,
I've only ordered postmates a few times and tbh none of them have been fantastic (orders incorrect twice, bad luck I guess). I don't blame the courier for this of course. But I have a chronic, degenerative disorder and ran into an issue with the driver tonight. Usually I'm quite mobile and I'll meet people outside because my apartment is a little difficult to find. However I ordered food tonight and got a text from my courier saying, ""I'll be there in 24 minutes, meet me out front."" I wasn't sure if we were on the same page, so I sent them a text back telling them how to get to my apartment in detail from the street as it could be tricky, and I'd meet them at the door. They again said they'd meet me out front, and I told them to please meet me at my apartment. I didn't want to drop the 'I'm disabled' card because I'm also not in a wheelchair and face a lot of ""You don't *look* disabled,"" rhetoric as a very able-bodied appearing young woman, even though I can barely walk right now and have been mostly bed ridden. I sent a pretty stern text back that said I paid for the food to be delivered to my door and I wouldn't accept it any other way.
The courier decided to drive to my apartment complex, mark the order as delivered, and drive off with it. I know this because I did in fact end up having to go down to the street and make my way back -- which was not fun for me at all -- to check she hadn't left it on the curb or something. Nope, just took it.
Naturally I'm not really happy about that, so I reported it and was given a refund but also canned replies. I kept telling them I wanted to make a complaint against the driver and kept getting, ""We're sorry it took so long to get your order, that must be frustrating!"" and ""We're sorry to hear the restaurant made a mistake"" (???). Overall it took like eight tries of asking them to read what had actually happened. I wish they had a phone number.
Anyway, after all of that, I was wondering if it's likely the driver will actually face any consequences? It kind of seems like Postmates in their emails to me were really dismissive (obviously I mean they couldn't even get the issue right) and there was no sharing of what a disciplinary process might be, or if they'd even talk to the driver. I ended up ordering instead from uber eats. Maybe I should have explained that moving is difficult, but I also don't feel like if I'm paying for something (and I always try to tip well, too) I shouldn't have to bare the brunt of my life issues with someone to get them to deliver something to my door.

Advice to get pings?(Chicago),"I'm new to postmates and this kind of gig. I got one delivery yesterday after over 2 hours of waiting. I'm in Chicago - 3 million people and it's this dead? I figured it wouldn't be a super overwhelming number of orders since I'm not in the loop, but this is ridiculous.
I don't want to work the loop because I'd end up paying far more for parking than I would make. Is this how it is all the time on the northwest side or is it just because it's not Friday/Sat? I know that Tuesdays are pretty dead but I don't know where I should go wait. Evanston? My first day (Monday) was 3 deliveries so wasn't bad.
Where should I go wait in my car? Has to be free parking.
I need to make many deliveries of any quality so I can meet my referral bonus. I got shafted by Postmates sitting on the bag/card package for over a week in California so I only have 10 days now. So I would really appreciate advice so I can give this job a chance. Kind of my last resort.

Way to offer to pay for accidental mess after tipping?,"Hi. I just had a ride with a nice driver, and I was coming back from the gym. I was still wearing my shorts and i normally change before i go places but i was in a rush to get home because i needed to take care of some personal things, and my car is out of commission so i have had to use ubers this past week. I ended up leaving a sweat stain where i was sitting and didnt even realize it until the driver turned around and was naturally upset about the situation because now he has to clean it and cut his work hours short. I apologized profusely and asked if i could pay for the cleaning but i had literally just rated and tipped on the app. I tried sending support a message offering to pay for damages but havent heard back. I feel horrible, i havent had something like this happen before and i know drivers use their personal vehicles for this. Is there anything i can do?
On a less important side note, i worry i might have some kind of undiagnosed sweat disorder from medications i had to start taking recently, which i just read can be a side effect.

Wanting to Drive for Lyft - but Service Dogs...,"To clear this up: I understand the laws put in place by ADA. I also totally sympathize with the people with service dogs. And I myself love dogs. But I take issue with this rash idea that drivers should accommodate Service Dogs, even if they're not service dogs at all (because the way the policy is phrased gives the OK for people to abuse this).
Also, how about allergies? They claim you can't discriminate people with Service Dogs but they're okay with discriminating towards people with allergies / medical condition? Why don't they have something in place for drivers to not allow pets into their cars so it's filtered out? Or at least have Lyft customers with legitimate service dogs register and verify the legitimacy of a service dog? It isn't hard to do. The fact that they even claim they don't need a vest? And yeah, I know that can be faked too, but it really looks like a free for all with no thought. It's unfair to people with legitimate service dogs and those who either don't want dog fur in their car but most importantly allergies.
They really need to revise this policy and ensure it isn't a Free for All or ""We favor this condition over another"".",[deleted],18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/6g9rfj/wanting_to_drive_for_lyft_but_service_dogs/,Lyft,"""medical condition""|""medical issue""",6g9rfj,2017-06-09,9,67,bjaqq,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Want more tips? Want to get tipped just about every time? This is how!,"Okay so this was a response to another person’s thread, but people seemed shocked/amazed/thought it was a great idea and it kind of hijacked the thread. So, I figured I would post it here for those of you that have trouble getting tips/getting good tips.
I have this premade in my notes app and when I deliver the food, before I hit “delivered”, I take the time to fill in the customers name, their order, if I mentioned something in person like “cool shirt” or whatever - you get the picture. Anyways, this is what I write, more or less, every time:
Hey [Insert name of customer]! I hope you enjoy your (you can just put meal or their actual order. I usually do the restaurant name) with UberEats! I just wanted to take a second to let my customers know that I work almost solely on tips, as many think the delivery fee is paid to the drivers. I rely 100% on tips to compensate for gas and maintenance. However, I completely understand if you are unable to tip and that is okay! Please give me a thumbs up if you had great service. Otherwise, please show your gratuity by tipping your driver! :-) If my service did not meet your expectations, please let me know what I can do to make your next experience with Uber Eats as excellent as possible. Have a great (insert evening! Friday! weekend! You get the picture)
Also, my $2 tippers went to $5 almost instantly. People truly assume we get the whole 4.99 delivery fee. We also don’t even get the whole .12/min .72/mile fee, Uber gets some. So, while I don’t technically rely 100% on tips, it’s safe to say I mostly do. The best part is, I hit delivered after sending it and I don’t have to hear “you suck im not tipping you” or whatever. I have only ever NOT been tipped 2x in the week I’ve been doing this (about 45 deliveries).
And the lowest tip I have got since has been $1.85 (from a guy on SSI) and the highest $20 on a $5 McDonalds meal (I know, I know)
But it works! Just thought I would share that with you guys.

"Uh oh, I think I’ve finally been inflicted with the infamous instacart shopper sick and tired of being sick and tired jaded side hustle personality disorder aka SAT2X","I just bailed on a $50 Costco order about 75% of the way through. The store was busy but not insane and there wasn’t even a case of water in the order. I’m always a champion of large, heavy orders because I don’t mind the workout, but I guess I found my breaking point. It came when I saw the customer had ordered 3x each of paper towels and toilet paper. The entire order was very fair from the ic payment to the tip, with only a couple miles to drive. Add to that no cases of water and on paper (pun intended) it was a solid order. But when I went to put those paper towels in my cart and then noticed the bath tissue also called for 3X I’d had enough of trying to play Tetris and was too stubborn to get another cart when my mind started racing with “what on gods green earth does a family need 6 packs of Costco sized paper products?” “they don’t need that many they are just being obnoxious and ordering more than necessary so they only have to order and pay for the service once because they probably got a coupon code for free fees.” Once that happened I knew I had to message support and remove the order. My brain tried to tell me to chill out and I’m only 20 minutes and a second cart away from my $50, but I couldn’t remain logical or reasonable. I just started a great paying job last week after being fired and unemployed for the first time in my life back in September. That’s why I started this gig, and overall I’ve loved it and it Has helped me to make ends meet while I look for a job, but I am now on my home stretch of having a regular paycheck, but because of how pay periods work and the delay in getting my first one, I have no choice but to do this on nights and all weekend to bring cash in. Soooo I guess I just lost my shit finally. I don’t know the point of this rant except that I know most of you here have also had your breaking points and maybe they don’t make sense with all the other stuff you have put up with, but I know I’m not alone!

UberEats is Trash !!!!!!,"I made a order from Nakata ( a japanese restarurant ) around 8:15 ( New York local time )
Order number #90097
Here is what I ordered:
* 1Botan Shrimp SushiUS$5.00
* 1Uni ShotUS$18.68
* 1Grilled LambUS$14.95
* The funniet in the world happened
.
At 8:50, I tracked the order, it shows me the driver (who supposes to delivery food from restaurant to me, I will call this guy driver below) is close to my house area, about in 1miles.
So I walked inside the dinning room waitting and waitting. \*\*\*\*\*\*After 20min, I still dont get any information ( like a phone call/ text message/ door bell )
basiclly nothing happened, I just sit in the dinning room and waitted 20min.
Then I opened my PC and checked the mailbox, the UBEREATS sent me the receipt, and which equals food is arrived and I picked it up.
Still waitting, At 9:30, I called the UBEREAT help line, they told me through phone:
(First, they tell me they \[\[can't\]\] connnect to the driver who works under Ubereat)
Is that funny?
(Second, they told me)
1. accoring to their track, the driver was on my house area
2. the driver waiited 7min
3. So they ""can't"" give me fund back according to their policy
\*\*\*Here is my question:
1. Does the driver is a disability? he can't knock my door? press the ring bell?
2. Does the driver don't have a phone? He can't call me or test me?
Without any notificiation except for a receipt email.
Here goes my conclusion:
The driver who parks his car around my house, enjoy the food what I paid for him, and then left.
\*\*\*
Its so funny the Ubereat side can't reach the driver, and know whats happening on, and blame the fault to me.
They have no evidence to show the driver delivery the food to me

Uber Setup,"So I feel like I was setup today by a customer. I received a Uber request and when I arrived the rider wasnt outside just yet. I waited a few minutes and then 3 guys came out with one in a motorized wheelchair, another in a suit, and the 3rf with a dslr camera pointed towards me which I knew then that he was recording me. The guy in the suit asked me if I can accommodate the rider in the wheelchair. I said that I will try and I asked how heavy the wheelchair is because it may be put o to my bed. I drive a ford f150. He stated that it was really heavy and even then if we were able to get it on that I wouldnt have any help at the destination. He then asked if I have a step stool gor the rider to get into my truck. I stated that I didnt but that I would align my truck next to the sidewalk and the side step will be able to assist him. But he made it point that it isnt enough. I then stated I rwally would like to apologize as I would not be able to accommodate their needs. And I asked if it would be ok to cancel the trip. You could tell he wanted to push the subject as he had been, trying making it a point that Uber is disregarding the disability needs but he stated I could. I then shock all 3 of their hands and apologized once more. I canceled the ride and drove off. Im pretty sure they did this to set me and Uber up.

"If mturk doesnt return to normal soon, IDK what im going to do. Disabled and broke","Hey everyone my name is shayla, i joined mturk in march of 2017 and i was doing it to earn much needed extra money to pay off super high medical bills, i am currently disabled living on disability, but in my area my disability benefits just dont cover all my bills + the medical bills, so I freelance on sites like mturk and stuff to get extra money because i am unable to work elsewhere or walk (i am in a wheelchair), for pretty much all the time since i started mturk i was comfortably making $30 a day and with relative ease by just doing quick little surveys throughout the day on my laptop. This $30 a day was a true blessing, i was always able to keep up making $30 day, in just week of work would already cover half of my monthly medical bills. But lately due to the bot scare ive been reading about i have seen so much less work that i thought that i lost some of my quals or something, but seeing how everyone on the forums says its also dead, I know its not just me so i guess i am not alone. I am barely making it to $10 a day in the same exact amount of time It normally takes me to get $30. I know i shouldnt depend on mturk so much but what other choice do i have, i am already drawing the max amount of disability that i can and i cant work to being wheelchair bound and also having epilepsy. mturk was the reason i didnt have to move out of my house and i was able to keep up on the mortgage payments. But now work is so thin i actually had to cancel several bills and water got shut off 2 times this year already. my question is, will this bot scare blow over and will we see surveys returning back as usual?? I am so depressed writing this because honestly i feel pathetic for having to rely on mturk to pay some of these bills that i am otherwise not able to pay normally. But do you know where i am coming from? im sure you also use mturk to pay the bills that you cant normally pay otherwise just like me. So what is a poor disabled woman like myself supposed to do, i even live in a town where more than 60% of its residents live below the poverty rate, so that doesnt help either. I just wanna know will this bot stuff blow over? i want to be hitting that $30 a day again like always.","You are not alone. I am not confident that it will pick back up, I am trying to think of alternatives too. I live in a remote area where poverty is also sky high. I work 2 jobs, but it's not enough.

Uber in the suburbs,"Hi drivers, I live in a small town about 30 minutes from the center of a relatively big city (~10 minutes from the edge of the city to my house). I'm disabled and have been finding Uber useful for getting around town but recently I've gotten some attitude for requesting rides for short distances. I think maybe the Uber app used to tell drivers where you were going or the estimated fare before they accepted the drive but that changed? It's not really my fault if there's a driver 5 minutes away who rejects my request and then somebody 20 minutes away picks it up, is it? Should I feel bad about using Uber for short rides?","What is your rating? I'm pretty sure it's really low; that's the reason why drivers close to you aren't picking you up. Drivers can't see your destination so they only have your rating to go off of. The driver who picked you up learned a valuable lesson and won't be picking you up in the future. While it sucks that you are disabled, a driver shouldn't have to pay to drive you around (they are losing money on the ride), Uber isn't a charity.

Two Accidents,"So, I was rear-ended in October (I wasn't delivering, but was driving to do an errand right after a delivery). Then today, I was side-swiped on the highway! The October accident was judged to be the other driver's fault, and I'm assuming this one will be as well....the cop even told me that the driver that hit me admitted to ""swerving on the highway"" and said it was due to a medical issue, and then she went to the hospital right after the accident. I was worried at first that being in two different accidents so close together was going to make Uber drop me, but then I realized there's really no way they would even find out since I'm already driving for them, that it would only be a problem if I was applying for them....Am I right about this?

My financed car will be too old for Uber. Concerned about my future.,"I’m freaking out because next year my car will be too old for Uber. My car is financed and when I first got it, I wasn’t doing Uber yet.
I was engaged and my ex fiancé wanted to buy a newer car to give us stability. Unfortunately, he turned to hard drugs and stole from me so he’s gone along with his financial help. Now I’ve been using the car, which is in my name only, for Uber. I just got the car last year and I’m realizing that next year my car will be considered too old to use for Uber. I also know that refinancing is not going to happen because doing Uber is a red flag to mostly every finance place... which I had no idea about before.
I’m freaking out because I’m realizing that Uber may not have been such a great idea. If my car was a lot newer, maybe, but with my car only having a year left, I’m going to be screwed next year if I don’t have a back up plan. I need a back up plan. It helps me feel stable and secure and right now I don’t have that.
I have been looking for work and sending my resumes, editing my resume, calling companies, doing everything I can to find part time receptionist work. I have back issues and I’m also on disability but my disability is not enough to cover the bills. Due to my back issues, I’ve been trying to look for an office job.
It’s frustrating because with a bad back and not being able to do a ton of lifting, my options seem more limited.
I thought about going back to school but I’ve already gotten my associates degree in business and it doesn’t do much to help me. Plus, studying business isn’t a skill. Most of my Pell Grant is used up so if I ever went back I would be getting deep into debt which I don’t want to do if I don’t have to because I’ve learned that college does not guarantee anyone a job.
Any suggestions? I’m trying so hard to be prepared.
I feel like this post can go in so many sub Reddit‘s, I just chose Uber drivers because that’s where I am right now.","If you want to keep doing Uber you will need to find a good used car. Shop for a Prius if your market is best for UberX. Prius has the best reliability rating of any car build in America and 45-50mpg.
Shop for a Grand Caravan (or equivalent) if you are in a good market for XL. My buddy does XL and generates about 25% more because he has a good Grand Caravan.

Trying to get my wife's phone from Lyft driver,"Wednesday night my wife and I attended a show at a club and called Lyft for a ride home. The ride started out bad. When the driver showed to pick us up, someone hit his car. He was pretty pissed. Anyway, after the ride, I tipped 20% as I always do and gave him 5 stars. We realize the next day my wife's phone had apparently slipped out of her purse. We did the find lost item in the app, but never got any response from the driver. We then used the app to contact customer support. Still no response. We've been using Google's ""Find my phone"" to actually track the driver and it's obvious he is picking up fares. So Lyft is being complicit here in that they're giving him fares while he continues to ignore us. At this point, I'm actually thinking about using my wife's laptop, tethered to my phone to try and track the guy down. I'm looking for any advice on getting her phone back. My wife suffers from anxiety disorder and panic attacks and I sick of watching her suffer. If I can't get the phone by Monday, I'm going to talk to an attorney about what legal processes are available to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","iPhone- you can ping it, he might not even know it’s in the car.log onto iCloud",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/c9gniz/trying_to_get_my_wifes_phone_from_lyft_driver/,Lyft,disorder,c9gniz,2019-07-05,0,9,CollectiveOfCells,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
risk of being suspended?,"I started turking 3 days ago and thought all was well until I read a number of comments from people who have had their accounts suspended due to Amazon not being able to verify payment stuff. I don't have any sort of a credit history. I already had an Amazon payment account so could help provide proof of my identity? I mean, I've purchased a lot of stuff on Amazon and paid for it with a card in my name (I'm an authorized user on one of my mom's accounts but as far as I understand this has no impact on my financial history)
To further complicate issues, I don't have a work history. I'm 25 and have had major health issues for the last 6 years and have been unable to work (aside from a job I had for 3 months when I was 18...probably won't help much!)
I was planning on moving money from my savings account and opening a checking account tomorrow so that I can take advantage of mTurks direct deposits. Would that help?
Basically, is there anything at all that I can do to prove my identity/avoid having my account flagged or suspended? All of my info is valid and I provided my SSN, but it sounds like other people have done that and still had issues. I would really like to take care of any potential issues before they arise. Would it be worth calling Amazon BEFORE my account is flagged?
As someone who is currently unable to work (and not receiving disability) mTurks would drastically change my financial situation, so I'm willing to do anything to make sure I can keep doing it.
I apologize if this has been asked before. I've searched for info on it, but my situation seems somewhat extreme in not having any credit/work history, so I wasn't able to find info.
Sorry this was so long. Any help would be greatly appreciated...I'm pretty nervous about this somehow blowing up in my face!","If you have little to no credit history and have filed very few taxes then yeah, there's a pretty good chance of them having ""trouble"" verifying your account.

DO NOT drive for Lyft. It's not worth it. I'm serious.,"Throwaway account. In early August an uninsured driver with a suspended license hit me, and it's been nothing but a living hell thus far dealing with Lyft and their insurance. I had a passenger in the car who was giving me directions, and I was slowing down to take a left turn in a quiet neighborhood. It's one lane each way, with roughly half a lane of extra space to the curb. My passenger then says to take a right, not a left. No worries, right?
As I approach the turn I switch my blinker from left to right, and then begin my right turn. Another car comes along my right side and clips my front right wheel/bumper area, severely damaging the wheel and rendering the car undrivable. Let that sink in for a second: this person tried to pass me on my right *while I was turning right.*
After I check to make sure no one is hurt, the cops are called, a police report is taken, and my car is towed. I'm calm and friendly but the woman is VERY pissed and refuses to give me her information, even though she hit me. I know exactly what happened on her end- she was going too fast and didn't give herself enough following distance to slow down in time for when I changed my blinker, and probably(?) chose to go around me on the right because she a) thought it was a second lane, b) thought there was enough room to get around me, and/or c) thought she could get around me in time. Spoiler alert: none of those things are true.
It took a full two and a half weeks for Lyft's insurance representative to get any concrete information to me, and those emails consisted of barely cohesive sentences. By that time, the police report was available which is when I learned the driver was uninsured and driving with a suspended license (which, yeah, explains a lot). The report also showed that I was absolutely not at fault and even included a helpful little diagram on the last page outlining what happened in the wreck. Insurance then tells me they won't cover a hit by an uninsured driver, even when I'm not at fault; my Trust & Safety representative dodges any and all of my concerns about that and simply refers me back to the insurance rep. After some research and calls it seems I wouldn't be able to pursue this in a small claims court because there were no witnesses aside from my passenger, who understandably wanted nothing to do with this and did not give a statement to the police (he immediately took another Lyft to finish his drive to work). Lyft's deductible is $2,500. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. My regular insurance company's deductible is $500. The-Other-Guy-With-the-German-Name's deductible is $1,000. Obviously if you're at fault you pay the damn deductible, but am I the only one who thinks it's insane that Lyft sticks their drivers with that cost when they have proof that they're not at fault AND that they can't get reimbursed from the other driver's insurance or through legal means? Furthermore, this insanely high deductible doesn't cover anything besides the repairs, and I was all set to move across the country a few short days later, meaning I ALSO have to pay for: -towing my car from the accident
-a rental car while the shop does the bare minimum repairs to get my car drivable so I can still move, repairs which still took more than a week
-Lyfts to and from the rental place and the repair shop (seriously? Lyft doesn't cover their own Lyfts?)
-a place to stay while the repairs took place, since I moved out of my old place in preparation for the move
If Lyft still refuses to do anything for me, then when all is said and done I'll have to pay almost $4,000 for an accident where I'm not at fault. That's more than ALL of the money I made driving for Lyft the past few months. It's also a LOT of money for me (read: I literally do not have that much money) because a) I'm a young recent post-grad and b) I've had to spend a lot of my own money on medical expenses for a condition that isn't relevant here, but it's worth noting that I've been driving Lyft for the past few months due to the condition. I am now homeless in a new city because I couldn't afford to pay for a new place to stay once I got here and learned the other driver was uninsured. So not only is Lyft refusing to cover me when I have literally no options to get my money back, but as I've said, the icing on the cake is how slow, unhelpful, and downright infuriating the insurance process has been. And YES, I know insurance as a whole sucks, but this is especially awful- and I've read other cases where Lyft drivers have felt the same way. I've reached my wit's end with Lyft after trying everything under the sun to gain some ground with them, so any advice here would be much appreciated. Aside from the aforementioned medical condition, this has undoubtedly been one of the worst experiences of my life.
Moral of the story: if you drive for Lyft (don't), you are assuming the risk that if an uninsured driver hits you (or even if you're in an accident where it's unclear who's at fault, for that matter) you will be stuck with a $2,500 bill for repairs AND whatever additional costs arise as a result of the accident. They let you know about the deductible up front (if you can pay it, great, fine), but they certainly don't highlight all this other crap I'm having to slog through.
tl;dr Lyft has the worst customer service I have ever encountered and has rendered me homeless. EDIT: Okay, so some fellow redditors are claiming that either uninsured motorist coverage and/or rideshare gap coverage from my regular insurance will cover me in this situation. **This is not true.** I actually HAVE both of these, as they are something I thoroughly researched before driving for Lyft. The former wouldn't apply if the app is on, period- it would either defer to rideshare gap or Lyft's insurance. The latter only applies if you have the app on but DO NOT have a passenger in the car, which is a time when Lyft does not provide coverage. I had the app on and DID have a passenger in the car, so neither of these apply to my situation. I repeat: it would seem that if you are in the middle of the ride and are hit by an uninsured motorist, Lyft simply will not cover it, which is what I take (great) issue with.","Sorry you're having to deal with this insurance nightmare. Two recommendations:
1. Get a lawyer letter sent to lyft. That should whip them into shape quick to get your payout covered. They hate bad publicity and lawsuits they'll lose
2. Don't let passengers tell you what to do, where to turn, or which route to take. The response I have which I deliver in a very ""commercial flight pre-flight announcements"" tone of voice is:
""For the safety of all passengers and to ensure that a consistently high quality ride is available for everyone, I only follow my GPS turn-by-turn designated course and navigation.""
If they start to whine/argue/protest in ANY FUCKING WAY:
""If you prefer, I can end the ride at the nearest safe drop off point and you can call for another lyft ride which should arrive inside of 10 minutes to take you on to your destination."" I've given that warning twice, never had anyone choose to end the ride. But if they do, yeah I have a script for that as well that I send to support. Immediately open a support ticket and cite the rider as rude and possibly under the influence of a mind-altering substance, asking incoherently for navigation changes and then requested for me to end the trip early.

Tale of the humpback!,"The tale of the humpback!
This might be long. . Get a call from Diamond! I was excited because it's usually one of the ladies of the night or maybe the strip club! They always tip $20.00, even on a bad night they still give you a $3 tip! I get there and it turns out not to be any of my regular ladies. It was 3 beautiful ladies, they were dressed in African attire, looking so beautiful, so many different colors of the rainbow, yellow, red, maroon, burgundy. One of them I could tell had a slight hump back and walked with a limp. I felt bad for her right away because people with disabilities work extra hard. As they got into my car, I noticed that the lady with the humpback wasn't getting into the car correctly. She was literally leaning all the way over but for some reason couldn't put her knees up, I thought maybe it was due to her disability. They all got in, one in the front and the other two in the back, then I asked them their names and ask them to all click their seatbelts. The lady with the hump on her back didn't move. I turned around and I told her ""you are precious cargo, I must make sure I get you there in one piece please click your seatbelt"". She had a little waist so I knew it would be no problem to bring that belt down and bring it across your waist. She looked at me funny. At that moment she grabbed the cloth of her dress and pulled it around and her hump on her back moved to her side but as it moved to her side it also started kicking! Right at that moment I thought to myself WTF! She had a baby wrapped up in her dress! I looked at her and said ""lady your hump is moving viciously and has moved to the side of your underarm! The lady in the front giggled! At that moment I asked the ladies did they have a car seat for the baby! All three of them shook their heads no in unison. I asked them to please step out of the car and that I could not take them with a baby with no car seat. As they were climbing out of the car and I was letting the timer run out I started laughing hysterically and I couldn't stop.
I got a message while I was waiting it was the lady asking me to hurry up and cancel the ride so that she could call another car right away because I was holding her up. I didn't answer, I just let the time run out. I called CS and ask them to unpair me and let them know about the baby with no car seat and even the little customer service guy begin to laugh at the story.

Let's start by saying I'm an all-time Elance supporter, it was where I started my career, and I'm not going to lie, I hated the ""merge"" with oDesk. Now that's out of the way, I need to say the first months UpWork seemed like a cool marketplace. But then, the 20% fee, poof, ok I can deal with that, but let's be honest, that just made most of us increase our hourly rates.
Now, what really, really makes me mad: the stupid success score. I have 20 completed projects, of which 17 are 5 stars ratings, 2 are 4,5 and 1 is 3,6 (there's always a hard to please client right?)
Now, how come my success score is 80%!!!! Are you kidding me? No, no recent account holds.
I contacted UpWork, and asked, support told me their algorithm to calculate this is a top secret and that I should try to make my clients happier, I told them that the 5 stars ratings kind of show that they are, and they told me that maybe the private rating wasn't as good and that I should reach out to understand what went wrong, I thought that was a good solution, and asked to understand which clients had left a bad private review, so I could reach out and stop making whatever mistake I was making... and support kindly told me they can't disclose that information.
So basically, UpWork's solution is for me to - even though the public feedback is perfect - try to figure out magically if there's a possibility that privately one or more of those 20 clients has a clear personality disorder and felt I was great one minute, and the worst the next one. Does ANYONE know how this is really calculated? I hate when thing's aren't transparent.","A major part of your score is from the hidden private feedback. Unfortunately, most clients aren't even aware that even scoring you an 8 on that will give you a drop from the Top-Rated requirement of 90% JSS (in most cases). Some clients just do NOT give perfect scores, how much ever work you put in, and Upwork struggles to understand this simple fact. It continues to frustrate their freelancers with these scores and fees. I, for one, have taken most of my services to LinkedIn - much better than worrying about useless scores that don't really help the client or the freelancer.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Upwork/comments/5z2wlx/success_rate_the_score_where_everythings_up_and/,Upwork,disorder,5z2wlx,2017-03-12,6,9,NitaMorales,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Do not recommend MTURK to anyone else until they pay a living wage.,"In the future everything will be done on platforms like this. Almost all office work can be put up here instead of given to somebody who a company is forced to pay for 40 hours a week despite the fact that half that time is spent at Panera Bread. Somebody who works every hour at their office job may be upset by that, but I am sorry, that is how majority of office jobs are. I know people making 60k+ a year, and I've gone to their houses and played video games with them while they just sent a few emails and got paid a days wage. There are also people who are extremely terrible with computers who are just being kept on board out of pity / to prevent ""discrimination"" lawsuits. If there were 40 plumbers in a town and there was only enough work for half of them to work full time, you wouldn't be telling more plumbers to come live around there. I signed up for flex like two years ago, and haven't gotten hired because they have enough people. Why would that logic work for some jobs at one of the richest companies in the world and not others? Also why would people be up in arms about a plumber getting paid $5 an hour ""Because they should be grateful, and because bosses can choose to pay whatever they want. Humans are just resources and I can choose whether I want to give them fuel or let them die"", but magically people are allowed to break wage laws on mturk? There used to be plenty more batches posted, but why pay a living wage when you can pay someone in another country $1 an hour. I am sick of being forced to live in hell and being forced to take jobs that pay $2 for 30 minute when rent is getting close to $1000 a month. ""Get a real job!"" My body is completely broken, including my hands and neck, but I can't get disability and am forced to make my body deteriorate even more just so I don't die of starvation. The idea that this is just side beer money is insane. Yeah, maybe if you are an 18 year old who isn't going to pay their loans for years, but nobody is working a 9-5, getting five minutes off, finding a hit, then waiting until a script catches it during their 5 minutes of downtime. Getting jobs on here requires being on call for requesters, many who are using government grant money at tax exempt universities, but somehow their work is worthy of tax dollars and used for scientific research but I'm just supposed to consider this a hobby and be grateful that I'm not dying. Some will counter with ""Well they are making people wait months now!"". Ok, and then they exploit those people until they have a higher hit count, and they work for a dollar an hour sometimes instead of that work being given to others and paid at a fair rate. I remember plenty of people on reddit beer money posting about how they aren't going to reveal the good sources of income because they don't want other people to ruin it for them. For awhile I thought that was greedy, but now I can see where they are coming from. Plus, why delude people into thinking they are going to come on here and make 100 a day? I have over 10k hits completed and my best day was 82, and sometimes I come on here for 12 hours. That's all I got. Feel free to let me know how entitled and greedy I am for working a job servicing society and wanting to be paid enough to live. I don't WANT ANYTHING like nice clothes/vacations, but I NEED food/rent/utilities, and I don't go to a doctor unless I am bleeding to death, but I can't have the bare minimum, and apparently society only exists so that only some people are allowed to prosper. Last time I checked society was designed so that we worked together instead of killing each other every time someone screwed someone over.",tl;dr,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/7xduhk/do_not_recommend_mturk_to_anyone_else_until_they/,mturk,disability,7xduhk,2018-02-13,0,28,SuitableMoment,1,hardship of gig work,n,1,venting,n,Agree,1,Agree,n,,1,,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,1,"benefit- can't get a ""real job""",0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Started a week ago, do creepy deliveries like this happen often?","So like I said, I started doing ubereats about a week ago. My boyfriend has been my passenger to help me get started since we live in a new city.
Anyways the other night close to dark, I got an order for Denny's. The guy ordered two smoothies and 4 sausage links. That's it. The Denny's guy handing me the food goes, ""oh yeah, this is that oddball order.""
I drive to the apartment where this guy lives and as I'm pulling up my boyfriend sees the guy standing in his doorway staring out. I get out alone and as I'm walking up the doorway he just stands there, this gigantic guy who's probably way over 6 feet tall as I'm a tall girl at 5'9 and he towered over me. I say ""hello Sam?"" and he answers in the highest pitch little girl voice I've ever heard.
I almost laugh it's so bizarre, but he has this super serious look on his face. He says yes in that voice. I walk all the way up to him and say ""Here's your ubereats order"" and am holding it out to him. He just stares me down and says thank you in that same voice, and I practically shove it into his hands because he isn't reaching out for the food even though I'm holding it out to him. I say ""okay, have a great night"" and he says ""you, too"" in same creepy voice.
My heart is pounding, but I feel safe as my boyfriend, also a big dude, is right there in my car. I tell him how creepy it was and he said he was watching the whole time because, while he couldn't hear him, he didn't like his vibe either.
I don't know if it was some prank on me that guy was doing or what. I didn't see signs of anyone else in his apartment through the open door, but you never know. And if he has some sort of mental disability I feel bad for feeling scared. But it was one of the most disturbing things to hear a child's voice come out of a huge grown man.

"SO FAR, IT’S BEEN A GOOD GIG","I’ve been dashing for about 2 weeks now. Hoping to make at least $1k per month. I’m fortunate that my husband has a good job and I don’t have to work full time. I have several health issues (breast cancer survivor, intestinal issues, and f’d up rotator cup), but don’t qualify for disability. Having the freedom to schedule when I want is perfect for me. I know the pay system is f’d up, but thus far, it’s been more than fair. I’m making anywhere from $15-$24 / hour. My last FT job, I made $16.09 / hour, but worked for a monster. That led to all kinds of physical & mental issues. Physically, my migraines, ulcer, & insomnia are gone. Mentally, I’m 80% better. I have anxiety & depression, but manage it with therapy. Working there in a basement office has soured me for working stuck inside a building. Get major anxiety just imagining it. I have a hybrid car, so gas is cheap (about .10 / mile). I know that doesn’t include maintenance and repairs, but the IRA deduction will help. Doing this gives me so much freedom. And I can listen to Audible or NPR while I’m working. And I’m getting to see areas of town I haven’t ventured into before (we’ve seen a lot of growth in the last 10 years.) Our Metro area has approximately 500k residents. Plus, I take my camera with me and will stop frequently to get pics of wildlife, a beautiful sunset, etc. And, now I’m contributing financially to our household. 🙂",I'm in much the same boat.

Sometimes I am amazed at what some of the pax can do with disability,"During the 1800 trips I had so far I only had a half a dozen pax with serious disability but I was amazed at their ability on using the app. I had a little people, he literally had to climb into my Corolla and when I dropped him off at a restaurant I had to open the door since he couldn't reach it. I had a young Pool pax with serious disability once (could only walk with crutches). I had to push the passenger seat all the way back to fit him in. Luckily I only had one other Pool pax that time who sat behind me. The guy with the disability told me that there was a driver there before me but he cancelled it because his ""check engine light"" all of a sudden turned on. I had one blind or partially blind person (without service dog), she could only see her phone if she held it about an inch from her eyes. At the drop off I walked her in into a grocery store. Once she was inside she said she was OK. I had a couple of pax with down syndrome and both of them were pretty smart with the app. I had pretty good/interesting conversation with all of these pax but of course we never talked about the obvious.",What I'm most amazed by is how they are using smartphones as they were intended.

Something very weird and mind blowing just happened to me while dashing 🤯,I’ve never experienced something like this ever in my life.... so while I was out dashing I got an order for piada and accepted it . While I was picking up the order I got a text asking if I was in line so I replied telling him that dashers don’t stand in line and that I was picking up the food. He replied saying “huh?” 🤦🏽‍♀️ I figured this was about to be annoying so I explained again and he said okay. So I got to the house and it was a 14/15 year old boy and he said thank you. When I was walking away he said “do you wanna make some extra money real quick” and the first thing that came to my mind was human trafficking or drug trafficking 😳😂 so I said “by doing what?!?” And he said “can you take my virginity” 🤯🤯🤯🤯 I was so caught off guard and shocked I left so quick 🤦🏽‍♀️ this boy was a little teenager and I’m 25 I just can’t believe teens are that bold. Or maybe he had a mental disorder and something told him to say that but I never had something like that happen.

I picked up two people from the ER...older lady (mid-50s-60s) and a 10-year old or so girl with Downs Syndrome or other mental disability. The lady was hobbling so I said ""oh no did you twist your ankle or something?"". She said ""no it wasn't me, it was my daughter here. We were wrestling and my daughter hurt her neck so we came here. Turns out she has whiplash."". Then she kept on being overly concerned for the girl ""on baby girl are you okay? Oh baby girl we'll get you lots of rest."". It was so over the top it made me feel uncomfortable...like something is off. After thinking about it more it seems fishy. This lady cam barely move, but can somehow wrestle?

"I'm on day 3 of trying to get started driving, but Uber Partner Support is absolutely inept and I don't even want to drive for them anymore.","I have a disability that makes keeping consistent work hours difficult, so I thought I'd try to deliver for Uber Eats to help my situation and pay down my medical expenses. I am a college comp sci student and worked as a customer service lead for the largest bank in the world for years. I know how to use apps, I know how to follow up on customer service tickets, and I know how to talk to people. Unfortunately, Uber doesn't seem to know how to do any of those. The trouble began after submitting all my driving documents and profile picture. Within seconds, I got an error saying my profile picture had been rejected. I took the picture with a hi-res camera against a green screen backdrop. I used Photoshop to perfectly center it. I was not wearing sunglasses or a hat. The app somehow flagged my picture immediately. I tried to reupload the same photo, and then the app changed to ""pending"" without an immediate rejection. I figured this meant it would have to be manually reviewed, so I gave it 24 hours. The next day, my profile picture showed rejected again. I contacted support on Twitter. ""We will be e-mailing you with additional information."" I received a template e-mail from a no-reply that said ""Please be sure your face is centered and you are not wearing sunglasses or a hat."" I took a brand new photo that followed all the rules and uploaded it. Status turned back to pending and I gave Uber the benefit of the doubt again and let it simmer for 24 hours. Day 3, picture rejected again. I contact support on Twitter. They very condescendingly say ""We're happy to help you with this issue but we need you to send this information in reply to the e-mails we've already sent you."" The ONLY e-mail I've got from Uber regarding this was the aforementioned template e-mail from a no-reply address saying ""take off sunglasses and hats."" I submit my fourth profile picture. I look in the app and see that Checkr wants a copy of my DMV abstract, so I pony up the $5 online and submit my DMV abstract through Checkr.
Day 4. Profile picture rejected again. Contact Twitter support again as they're the only point of contact for me regarding this. Again: ""We need to keep this information in one place and ask that you follow up these concerns with the agent that has e-mailed you previously."" 2 no-reply e-mails in my inbox now both instructing me to take off my hat and sunglasses. I receive a text from a Micah with Uber who tells me that I never followed up on the information Checkr requested. I tell them I submitted my abstracted on Checkr the day before. The agent says ""You must have had some trouble then because I can't see that it was ever received."" So, for the fourth day in a row, I'm submitting documents and profile pictures that continue to get lost or rejected and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Is this a normal experience with Uber?

The same thing happened to me when I was starting out. My profile picture was rejected multiple times because it was in-appropriate.

Well... I kept getting rejected so I decided to have one with me at the carnival. The photo was clear and centered but once again I got rejected.
So what I did was I went to my window, placed my camera there and made sure the curtains were open so I could have natural light coming into my room.
I then took a photo of myself and used that as my profile picture. It was accepted! So all I have to say is to make sure you are in a brightly lit area and then TAKE a photo using the uber app rather than uploading a photo.

Disabled driver needs an assistant. Will Uber allow this?,"I want to become an Uber driver to make a little extra money to help cover the bills. However, I have one problem. I'm disabled. I can drive without issue but I would not be able to help people in and out of the car, assist with their bags at the airport or any other physical needs. If I got sent to another disabled person's home, I definitely would not be able to put their wheelchair in my trunk, since, well my own chair is there.
I can solve most of this problem by bringing my husband with me. He would be dressed well, clean shaven etc., and treat any of our guests with dignity and respect. He would help with bags. He would be quiet and offer whichever seat the rider preferred. He would also be silent through out the ride unless the guest wished to talk to him. He would do the driving himself except he's partially blind.
So my question is, would Uber allow this? I've heard of drivers getting fired for having other people in the car. But this is kind of a delicate situation. Advice?

Shipt is stealing from you!,"Ever wonder how Shipt affords its services? They charge you full price on sale items and then pocket the difference! Our shopper accidentally left the receipt in the bag on our last delivery (which they are trained NOT to do), and the amount was 23% less than we were charged! When we called to ask about the discrepancy the representative said that it was because of sale items. So, you pay the Shipt price and if the shopper finds it for cheaper in the store then Shipt pockets the difference! And that’s how they afford their services, and make a mint in the meantime. So, you not only pay a membership fee AND tip your drivers, but you’re also paying (based on our conversation with the Shipt representative) a HUGE markup on your items! The representative said it’s usually around 10% but in some instances, like ours, it can be MUCH more! So, if you’re disability requires it and you’re OK with the upcharge, then by all means, continue using Shipt. But if you’re able and your hard earned money means anything to you, just make the trip to the supermarket and save yourself a boatload of money.","You're paying a service for the convenience of them having someone not only walk around the store to shop your grocery order, but also do the work of ensuring the products are suitable for you, communicating with you constantly for any potential stock issues / substitutions, bagging it, loading / unloading into the cart, out at checkout, back into the cart, then into their car, then drive it to your house, unload it all again, and be courteous, smile, and friendly and on time. Oh, and this person gets a measly $10 for doing all that work.

Sex with Pax / Driver? How many?,"I've been ranting about the pitiful new lyft rates all morning. Let me post about something pleasurable...
How many of you have had sex with a pax , or maybe even a driver? Not necessarily on the spot, but maybe you met someone who you eventually had sex with soon after. I'm at 3.
Brittany was suuuuper outgoing, very nice, very fun and cool, we had a good convo about video games, anime, and just cracking jokes. We're both black, in the hood (Watts, south central l.a), but had diverse and widened interests. So she gave me her number, to ""play fortnite"". A couple of weeks later we hung out, and just had an overall good time smoking weed, drinking, and watching anime. nothing happened that night, but a few nights later we did it all. She was mesmerized by my endurance, size, and my oral skills, so we were Fwb for about 4 months until she ghosted me, eventually saying she had a medical issue, and legal issues to get custody of her daughter. So we kinda parted ways from there.
Auri was new in town from Chicago, and didnt know many people yet. We had a really cool convo, and she was apologetic because she took a while to come down. But it was 6:15 am, so I just waited it out (first ride of that day). She was complimenting my beard, and was surprised that I look so young. She thought I was 22, when I'm 31. She also mentioned that she always gets old drivers. and that I'm the first young black driver shes gotten, and blah blah blah. So we had a good convo, dropped her off, and before she got out, she said, ""I dont want to seem like a creep, but you're real cool, and I need some friends out here. Can I have your number?""
We exchanged, I texted her to have a good day of work. and it was a pleasure to meet her. We talked later that night, the next morning I offered to take her to work again for free, we hung out that night, and I was getting oral, amongst other things (not sex, we were in the car) . The next night I was smashing, and smashed for a while until she got too clingy. She wanted to see me all the time and acted like an adult brat when I didnt come by. So I ended that, but I been trying to rekindle lately, cause a good FWB is always great to have.
Finally, Kim and I also had a cool convo. This was about straight up issues plaguing the world, homeless issue in l.a, etc. It was a real ass convo, and we ended up trading instagrams because we both appreciated the deep conversation. She wasnt as fine as the other two. to be honest, not very fine at all, but she was/is real cool. We hung out and I beat it up real good. She was out of breath, tapping out, talking about how she never had anything like that. My endurance is solid, so I was owning that shit! Her ex was obviously lame, because doggy style she lost her mind, and she was nervous to ride because she claim she never did it. So I let her get on and learn, oh she also didnt know how to give good head, so I let her do it while I kinda gave her guidance.
Those are my 3, how about yours??

"Scam Alert via Google Hangouts ""Interview""","Received a notification for an interview today. I accepted the interview but the job listing had already been deleted. The invitation contained a gmail address. The ""interview"" was supposed to be conducted via Google Hangouts. Because the listing was deleted, I emailed the address with my cover letter and resume.
It became clear quickly something wasn't right but I kept it going for a bit. In the middle I googled some of the description and discovered a LinkedIn discussion from others with similar experiences. Evidently it's some sort of check scam.

Turking made me eligible for Medicaid in my state as a disabled worker :),"Hi, I just wanted to add this tip in case it helps someone else. I am disabled and living in the US. That makes me eligible for Medicare, but I was still responsible for 20% of doctor's costs and restricted from certain clinics. Since my disability income was ""too high"", I was not eligible for Medicaid which covered all the costs. Anyway, in certain states there are programs for workers with disabilities that go by different name depending on the state. Search for your state plus Medicaid workers with disabilities, or disability medicaid buy in program. I thought because I didn't earn very much turking that I would not qualify but I was wrong, this fits the federal requirements for self employment and also this program!
I now have 100% of my health care covered at a small premium. I am really grateful to Amazon for letting me have a nice way to earn a little extra money that makes me eligible for health care. I hope this tip can help someone else or you can share this with a loved one :) This trick should work for seniors as well.

"I feel like I'm going nowhere with this site, depressed, no money and suicidal","I was just browsing the mturk members page on Facebook and there was so many people who were all saying they made over $300 yesterday, They of course didnt say who it was they worked for and I guess I should of expected this, this makes me feel like I dont even know what I'm doing on Mturk and I feel like a a total piece of shit for wasting so much time on here, I set here for hours and hours and I make around $5 an hour while they seemingly have it easy. I assume all these groups of ppl have closed quals? But I have gone far and wide to search out closed quals and even did every one on qualifeye on turkrview weeks ago and regularly check it for updates. So what am I missing?, I have been in a very tough situation life wise and I'm still waiting for disability to see if I can get disability benefits, I suffer from chronic depression and PTSD from my army days. So really the kind of work I can do is very very limited to only stuff I can do from home. I wanna use Mturk to help pay for bills too, not just depend on the kindness of my family, who are paying my bills until I get approved for disability. Until then I'm literally living off my friends money and that just makes me feel even more depressed because I feel like I totally failed at life to the point to where I have to depend on other ppl to pay my bills. I lost my true self, my independence. I will prob just delete this post, but I need to rant, when you post about your large daily earnings your not encouraging other ppl, your just making them (me) feel worthless, like were not even doing mechanical turk properly.

Reminder: You can ask two questions to a passenger claiming they have a service animal.,"It's funny to me how Lyft sends an email every month about how drivers are required to accept service animals. What they DONT do is give the drivers resources to help them follow ADA laws. From the ADA website:
""In situations where it is not obvious that the dog is a service animal, staff may ask only two specific questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform?""
The owner should easily be able to answer these questions. If responses are vague or they use the term ""support animal"", tell them the difference between support animal and service animal and refuse service. Also tell then to kindly fuck off (if you're that type of person).",Enjoy the deactivation.

Tasker horror stories,"I got paused for being unable to find tasks I could do. This is a bit long winded so please bear with me. I had my cat get sick over the weekend and had to choose between vet or Tasking. She got worse and I had to decline two jobs due to this. TaskRabbit was forcing me to choose between working to feed myself or saving my cat if she had problems. TaskRabbit has had zero mercy even when I presented a page long email of evidence of my consistent employment issues. The worst part is this is my only work option left. I am autistic and considered an ""undesirable"" by entry level industries at best, ""completely unemployable"" at worst. Because of my disability and needing a day program to get out of the house, I'm limited to daytime hours and in Marin County. I am now unemployed and on the verge of eviction, eating what few scraps I can successfully ""scrounge"" (read: mooch or steal from fridge at mom's....I live at home but she viewed me taking food out of her kitchen to live as stealing, hence my use of the word). Even worse, if I lose my Tasker status, I am on the street as my ability to stay at parents home is contingent on working. No work, no home. And in my city, virtually EVERY act committed to survive by a homeless person is banned by a myriad of ordinances. So in short, TaskRabbit is slowly pushing me towards losing everything, ranging from money, to a roof over my head, to a clean criminal record. I am at a loss what to do.","Getting paused is no big deal, you have to do a 5 minute refresher on the policies then you can task again.

"I know people ask about taxes all the time so I'm really sorry to be bringing it up yet again, but can someone please explain how taxes on this work REALLY REALLY SIMPLY for someone who knows nothing about taxes?","Started doing mTurk a couple weeks ago, made about $15 in a couple hours and was loving doing it, then decided to research how the taxes on these things work before going any further. I searched this subreddit and some forums and came up with a ton of information. *However*, there was a lot of conflicting information and a lot of it I just didn't understand because I know nothing about taxes. I got super overwhelmed by it all and just quit, because I was far too confused and it didn't seem worth the trouble.
I've gotten so much information and a lot of it contradicts other information I've gotten. Some people say you don't have to worry about filing taxes if you don't make a minimum of $X per year, some people say that's not true, some people say you have to make quarterly payments because you're self-employed, other people say *that's* not true either, some people say you can just file at the end of the year and pay a certain percentage of what you made, other people say you don't have to file at all. After thinking it over, I decided I'd like to give it another shot. I can't work actual jobs due to disability right now and I'd like to have *some* form of income. I need to find out exactly how taxes on it work first though, so can someone explain to me *in really basic terms* how it works? I don't know anything about taxes or forms or any of that. I just need a *really basic* rundown of what I'd have to do if I wanted to keep doing mTurk. Explain it to me as you would a child.
If I have to make quarterly payments - How do I know how much to pay? Is there a deadline for payments? Do I have to fill out any forms?
If I have to just file at the end of the year and make a payment then - Do I have to pay it all right away or can I pay it off in time when I'm able to?
If it's relevant, I'm living at home and dependent on my family, and I have no other job. I worked for a few months last year but didn't make a ton of money - maybe $1200. I didn't do my own taxes, either - my parents just had their tax person do mine while she was doing theirs, and I'd assume that's what we'd do come tax season next year with my mTurk stuff so I probably won't have to worry about filling out any forms myself.
Also, I probably won't be doing mTurk consistently but just here and there when I need some money for a particular thing or something. That in mind, the amount of money I make per week/month/quarter/whatever is going to be inconsistent and I probably won't be making a ton of money over the course of the year, so that might affect things.
Thank you *so* much to anyone who can help me with this.

Why I had to make $1006 in a month.,"I made a post briefly congratulating myself for hitting the quadruple digit mark. I expected jokes about how PM would NEVER reward me, but I got... mixed reception.
Anyway, I've been wanting to tell this story for a while, so here it is.
Due to many unlucky and generally bad things that happened to me as a child, I grew up mentally ill. My mental illness prevents me from having a 'normal' job. I can't work for more than 6 hours without really wanting to not work anymore, especially at a desk or doing something tedius and repetetive.
Due to many unlucky things and mistreatment from my (well meaning) parents, I left adolescence into a world I wasn't prepared for, attempted to leave the abusive household quicker than I should have, and really messed up my chance at having a stable future. While there are some things my now retired parents are willing to continue paying for, I now have no car insurance, no health insurance, and no home. I live in my car, and though it's reliable and runs well, it's all I have. That and my phone. I have renovated the back, removed the seats, added a floor, a cooler and camping stove, some storage, and a hammock to sleep in. It's comfortable, it's me sized, and it's me shaped. I could live like this for years if I wanted to. The problem is, I still have to eat and put gas in my car.
So I decided to escape my parents in Texas by living in California, which of course means that the cost of living is ridiculously high. I really didn't have a chance when I came here. But, I live in my car, and my weekly expenses when I neglect all luxury are about 120 dollars. This includes the gas I use to do Postmates.
I decided, almost exactly a month ago, that I was just going to do it, it was the only job I had a chance at keeping, and I would do it until I got tired of it and think of something else. At least that way I'd have SOME money, maybe.
As it turns out, with my extremely minimalist lifestyle, Postmates makes me plenty of money. I generally make between 150-200 bucks a week, which is enough for everything I need and a nice snack here and there. I've been on a diet, so snacking is a luxury. I make more on good weeks. And the best part is, my mental illness doesn't interfere, and I don't have to work full time. I can focus on ways to get treatment or treat myself in my downtime, which I have been working on a lot, and my disability isn't effecting me nearly as much as it used to.
I have other delivery apps available that I can fall back on if my PM rating drops, but out of the ones I've tried and heard about PM sounds like the one I want to stick with, even with all their problems. For now, anyway. I'm getting an eBike soon, which I can use to do some deliveries and save money on gas. I'll have more money, or less work time. It's totally up to me, and that's the greatest feeling. I don't really feel like I'm stuck or out of control or even really unstable. Anything could happen and I don't have much of a safety net, but my life has always been that way anyway.
Also just as a note, I did PM for a week in the past and made around $170 off that, which counts toward the total $1006. So I didn't really make $1006 in a month, but close.

PSA: It is illegal and against Uber policy to not accept service dogs in your ride,"Hey drivers, I’ve been seeing a lot of disappointing threads on twitter recently of disabled people who cannot get rides because of their service animal and/or wheelchair. I know this is not a new issue and that it’s something Uber and all of us are aware of butt I just thought I’d remind new drivers that they cannot deny service because of a service dog. It does not need to be disclosed to you beforehand if someone has a service animal or a disability. We cannot ask. I do hope that Uber puts a policy in place where drivers who have allergies/legitimate PTSD from dogs can disclose that and where riders with service animals can do the same so that they won’t be paired with one another and everything can remain anonymous. These threads are really upsetting to me and I hope we can all do better.","Service animals are allowed and we can't turn that down, but we can certainly turn down emotional support animals because they aren't service animals.

PSA to divers about service dogs vs therapy dogs vs emotional support dogs,"In light of recent posts, I wanted to make sure people understood the difference between these 3. -The only one you are required to take are service dogs. Service dogs are dogs trained to perform a task specific to their handler’s disability. This could include guiding the blind, responding to an epileptic seizure, or pulling a wheelchair. Service dogs do not have paperwork or registrations nor are they required to wear vests. They also can be any dog of any size and can be “owner trained”. -Emotional support animals are NOT service dogs. Emotional support animals are just pets that a doctor or mental health care provider wrote you a note for. They are sometimes allowed in otherwise no pet housing and on airplanes. They have no public access and are not allowed in restaurants, stores, and what not. They have no legal right to be in a Lyft or uber because their protections are for housing and air travel only. They are regular pets. There is also no registry or certification for emotional support animals. -Therapy dogs are dogs that usually work in hospitals or schools to provide comfort. They do not provide any service to their handler. The dog and their handler work as a team and usually volunteer to cheer up sick people. They have no public access. They might be allowed in a hospital or school to work but they have zero public access or Rights in the back of a Lyft. The problem is that MANY people do not understand these differences and really believe that ESAs and therapy dogs are a type of service animal. This makes it hard for actual service dogs because so many people think that untrained ESAs are service dogs which makes a lot of us want to call bullshit on the real ones. Now with all of this said, Lyft’s policy is only that we take service dogs, not ESAs but if someone with an ESA complained to Lyft I’m not confident they would back you up.","Just print this out: https://adata.org/sites/adata.org/files/files/Service_Animal_Booklet_2014(2).pdf Ask the two allowed questions: 1. Is the animal required because of a disability? 2. What work or task has the animal been trained to perform?

"Please stop cancelling or worse ""no show"" fee-ing my disabled father. (RANT)","Over the last year, I've been using this service nearly everyday for my dad, who is 74 and in a small wheelchair. We have cut down to once or twice a month because it's always a complete nightmare.
It goes like this. First, my dad goes outside - we never order the lyft until he is out and waiting. Then we order the lyft. Then I text the driver ""Hi, your passenger is at X and he's the grey haired gentleman in the black wheelchair."" At this point, there is a 50% chance that the driver will cancel on me. OR they won't see the txt message, show up to our residence - see my dad there with his chair - and drive on. At this point, they send us a cancellation or very often a ""no show"" fee which is just icing on the insult cake and a lie because I never even order the lyft until he is already outside waiting at the front door to avoid this exact situation. I have to keep reordering the lyft until we find someone that will take him. Often 2 or 3 drivers will cancel in this way until we find someone. Their policy is that foldable chairs can be accommodated. But it feels like drivers either aren't aware of this or simply don't care, or perhaps don't want to be bothered with it. The times where the drivers have been compassionate and actually gave him the ride are so rare that I can remember each one. I have complained about this TO lyft, and the best they can do is offer a ""$5"" credit. What? At this point, I don't even want the credit because I don't want to use the service, but even if I did - that is just insulting. ""Sorry we discriminated against you for your disability, here's $5!"" Is it really so inconvenient to pick up someone in a small wheelchair? Is there anything that I can do differently in the way that I order it, or perhaps I'm texting the wrong things to the driver? I am very specific, tell them what my dad looks like, that he is right out front, and in a foldable wheelchair. Since this usually gets cancellations right off the bat - maybe I shouldn't disclose this? I am just trying to be helpful by letting them know where he is./what he looks like/who they're picking up.
Is there anything I can do differently? Am I in the wrong here and just missing it? The last person I want to be is some haughty ""let me speak to your manager"" demanding, condescending, asshole if I am using the service wrong - I need to know that. Thanks for reading.
TLDR - Old man in wheelchair gets ignored by string of drivers for reasons.","Are you expecting or requiring that the driver assist your father to and from the wheelchair either at the pickup or destination? I can see a driver being hesitant to give a ride to someone in a wheelchair if they need to physically pick up the person to move them into and out of the car. If you are requiring assistance from the driver, you will probably continue to get cancellations. If not, make sure to tell the driver that they will not need to assist in moving him.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/a25zq7/please_stop_cancelling_or_worse_no_show_feeing_my/,Lyft,disability,a25zq7,2018-12-01,8,52,tragicclearancebin,0,,,0,customer POV,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

please don’t park in disabled spaces for deliveries?,"Even if you’re only staying for a minute?
I’m a disabled Postmates customer. I order delivery when I am too sick to drive & the drivers consistently decide that the disabled spaces are a good place for them to hang out until I get outside.
My disability is pain-related, so I am very, very aware that when you need disabled parking to be available, you need it. If I’m trying to use a disabled space, it’s because I’m already in excruciating pain and can’t walk further. By taking a disabled space, you are making it unavailable to any disabled person who needs it.
(And if you’re thinking “well I’d move if someone needed it” - really, would you move if someone came up and honked at you to move? Or would you get annoyed that someone was interrupting your delivery? My experience is that if I need a disabled space that someone is using as loading zone, they’re considerably more likely to swear at me than let me use the space that I have a permit for & they don’t. Or hang out there pointedly and refuse to move, as my pain gets worse and I just want to get inside to take drugs.)

Pax with disabilities,"I recently had my uber driver account suspended after being accused of denying a disabled passenger. I didn't; I never even laid eyes on the supposedly disabled passenger who simply didn't show up on time.
Uber reactivated my account after their 'investigation' but not before chastizing me for the thing I didn't actually do and then threatening me some more with deactivation should they ever again get the idea that I did do it.
It left a bad taste in my mouth -- not least because the suspension of my account also froze my access to instant pay, just before the 1st. And, really Uber? That's all it takes? One unsubstantiated claim of discrimination and I'm guilty until proven innocent?
Anyway, the message I received from uber support, which was littered with informational links about how to handle passengers with disabilities left me with some questions and a bit of disbelief about what I'm supposedly required by law to provide. In 2 years of driving for Uber I've never once encountered a passenger with a wheelchair and I never expected to. I drive a prius. Maybe some types of wheelchairs could fit in the hatch, but idk. Also, there was a link to a video about how to collapse/expand/stow wheelchairs. Am I a caretaker for free, by law? What if I'm disabled myself? Who wins the needy awards then? I recently injured my foot and needed crutches to get aronud. Am I required by law to be able-bodied enough to get out and push a wheelchair around?
On short rides I'm making around $2.60 in my market. That means I could be called on to, what, drive to the destination, track down the pax, wheel pax up to my car, help shove their carcass into my car, fold up their wheelchair, drive them to their destination, unfold their chair, help drag their carcass back out again? For under $3? Shouldn't they be calling a special service for that? shouldn't they at least have to pay me extra for all that? Why do I have to go out of my way and essentially foot the bill for specail care when I barely make enough to pay rent working 10 hour days? Is this shit for real, or can I legally just show up and provide exactly the same service that I provide to everyone i.e. sit in my car until the timer runs out?","You are not required to help disabled people. You don’t have to push, fold,load a wheelchair and you don’t have to make room somehow for shit that doesn’t fit. But you can’t say no because of the disability. Same idea as the service dog.

"I never reported Mturk to EBT for 6 months, how screwed am I?","I completely and stupidly forgot to report Mturk to my case worker. I never passed my thought, Mutrk to me is just a side gig and just like a regular crappy survey site where i make like $5 as day, I never saw it as a real job or work. But now my EBT benefits are cancelled due to their new ""Able-bodied"" program. It says that because I am an able bodies adult with no dependents that I cant receive benefits for myself because it says I have to be mentally ill (which I am) and have to work 20 hours a week at minimum or attend a work release program, so If I go to the EBT office now and report that I started Mturk 6 months ago, they will arrest me for failure to report income right?

Order problems four times in a row?,"We ordered from Jersey Mikes and the subs are $9 and don't specify a size, just saying original.
So we buy a couple for dinner and the next day and they're half a sandwich.
We got Carl's Jr, two for each of us, and one of mine was missing, the next days meal.
We got Firehouse and instead of white bread, wheat... I hate wheat more than anything.
And tonight we got El Pollo Loco and two orders of Churros. Not a single churro arrived.
The receipts we did get [Carl's and El Pollo Loco] show that we did get charged for the missing items. [Edit- and that both mine and my grandma's sandwiches from firehouse were supposed to be white]
Is this a social experiement? Are we ordering too much and Postmates wants a reason to drop us [too many reports of missing or improperly prepared food]?
Or is it genuinely just a series of bad orders?
I'm disabled, live with my grandma, neither one of us can drive, I can only handle going to the store once or twice a month and even that... I have brain swelling and some other stuff. So it's pain.
I'm so worried we're going to get blocked from Postmates from complaining too much but when things are paid for and missing, food isn't properly prepared or not... trying to think of a word for Jersey Mikes... like, it's the same price as Subway and Firehouse, it's a slight step up from Subway but no where near as quality as Firehouse. But it's half the length. Full price...
I don't know the word for that... They didn't say a length but the price and calling it original implies footlong, right?
And they say a footlong [called extra long or something] can feed 3-4 [or 3-5? I don't remember] but even the skinniest people I know can handle a footlong on their own... yeah I'm be vert stuffed after but still... it's good for two meals, not 3-4. I can't think of the word for what that is.
Anyway, are we going to get in trouble? Is it even legal for them to get mad at us for something not our fault?
I got food poisoning from Pizza Hut and they kept saying it was only me who got sick and were calling a lot and asking questions and the insurance company they had called and it was just too much. We don't get Pizza Hut anymore... the thought of it turns my stomach.
But I don't want something like that to happen again but with Postmates. I woke up suddenly and realized that I didn't see the churros because I put the food away after I was full from a few bites of the quesodilla I got, and my gramma didn't even know I got them it was going to be a secret. But then I went to go to sleep and forgot but realized I didn't see the clear and green container I've come to associate with delicious fried, cinimom and sugar goodness.
And it wasn't there. So I reported it. I was so ashamed of how many times we've reported stuff is wrong that I didn't even report that our food was cold. Not just cool. It was cold like it was in the fridge for an hour.
Tip; El Pollo Loco food isn't good cold.
But yeah, when it's food missing, I don't care, I WILL report that EVERY time!
I maybe should have reported the food cold but whatever. Gave nourishment, wasn't made wrong... just didn't taste good.
Tl;dr- worried that postmates is going to block us because past four orders have had stuff missing or prepared wrong.
The first order was a full refund and we immediately ordered something else and there was nothing wrong with that order, so technically 4 out of the last 5?",Sounds like you have a pretty unhealthy diet.

On what criteria do drivers rate passengers?,"I'm disabled and can't drive, so I use Lyft daily to get to and from work, and to get to social events. I always try to be polite and friendly to drivers, and try to make things easy on them. When they try to make conversation, I'm usually more than happy to. However, due to frequent illness there are often days when I will simply sit in silence for the duration of my commute, I just can't bring myself to really hold conversation for long.

I only really rate 3 stars for people who I never want to see again. And its only people who lie about not needing my bucket when I ask them. I dont care if people puke, I just don't want a mess in the car. Hence the bucket. People are too embarrassed to hold it for some reason.

People with second homes, vacation homes. Bored retirees saying how fun it’d be to mess around and make some money and beat the boredom.

NJ - Worker's Comp?,"I have a family friend that's an insurance adjuster. She told me that in NJ a commercial driver MUST have Worker's Compensation Insurance because the law allows the auto insurance companies to lower the Personal Injury Protection (PIP) expecting that the driver is covered by the Comp insurance. That, as an Independent Contractor I am supposed to carry it on my own and it will be expensive. She said without it Uber is not liable for my injuries while driving for them, or at least I''ll get a lot less then I may need.
So how true is this? How can Uber call us Independent Contractors and not check to see if we are covered? When I hire someone to come work on my house I make sure they are licensed and that means they carry the requisite insurance (Worker's Comp, Liability, Disability), why doesn't Uber?","That insurance adjuster is only half right.
You do not have to buy your own workman's comp insurance. She is correct in that you will not be covered by Uber for any injury to yourself and Uber is not liable. This is one of the ways that Uber uses to get valued so highly in the market - bu screwing of over for things like that.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/3mhr58/nj_workers_comp/,uberdrivers,disability,3mhr58,2015-09-26,2,3,Jacknife_Johnny,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Abusive Door Dash Driver:Any Advice?,"Hey folks, this might be a long one, but I’m a gig worker. I’ve worked for Lyft, Uber and even Google as a contractor. I have a day job, but my medical bills are through the roof, since I have an autoimmune illness, so I am well acquainted with what it’s like to be a gig worker. I sit on several direct action boards to help improve conditions for gig and minimum wage workers too. Basically, I’m not a total a hole. So I’m having a really serious flare up of my autoimmune illness today. I’m in so much pain that moving is almost completely out of the question for me, so I order door dash. I live in a large, somewhat higher end condo building with high security, so I try to make sure to tip really, really, really well always, for any extra trouble it might be for a driver to deliver to someone in a high security building, with a disability. Today, I ordered Door Dash. I always leave detailed instructions and follow up with a text and sometimes even with a phone call, to make sure drivers don’t get lost, and to make sure they get the appropriate directions. Today was no different. My door dasher shows up and starts calling and texting me, telling me I gave him wrong directions. I’m extremely puzzled, because I left him extremely detailed instructions...twice...AND stayed on the phone with him, attempting to guide him up to my apartment. For some reason, he had randomly decided that the instructions I had given him were wrong, and so he decided he should disregard them and then blame me when he couldn’t get in. He became extremely belligerent with me, swearing, yelling and sending through constant texts. He accused me of “purposely trying to ruin his day,” swore at me, and THEN asked me to buzz him up to my apartment AFTER he had lost his sh*t (because apparently after disregarding my directions multiple times, he decided to try following them...). I never raised my voice with him, I was polite, I was respectful, I asked him immediately upon picking up my order if he was comfortable coming up to my apartment, since I’m having trouble walking today. He said this was fine. I even left him extra tip just for making the trek upstairs (it’s not like it’s out of his way. You park in the covered spots, go in through the glass door, I buzz you in, then there is an elevator right there. My apartment is right by the elevator once you get to my door, so it’s probably the equivalent of walking to someone’s door on a house delivery.). Anyway, this guy complains (I guess he didn’t want my instructions to be right, and when they were, that was somehow upsetting...? Or something?), loses his mind, argues with me, calls, hangs up, calls, hangs up, calls again, hangs up, throws in a few rude texts, and then wants me to still buzz him in, once he finally follows my instructions on how to enter the damned building. At this point, I’d been nothing but calm and respectful, if not super duper happy clappy, cause hi, I’m in a severe amount of pain, but he’s over there losing his mind. Because of his behavior, and because god only knows what he has done to my food by this point and whether or not he is armed or mentally unstable, I make the decision to ask him politely to please leave the food where he’s standing and exit the building. The bizarre texts continue to come, and I let him know that I’m sorry he felt confused about my instructions, but that I’m not comfortable with him coming up to my apartment. Dude chooses, instead of leaving, to continue mashing buttons on the buzzer to see if someone will let him in, so I call the door people and ask them to keep this guy the hell out of our building, and to throw the food away, because he didn’t appear to be mentally stable and seemed abusive, and I wasn’t comfortable eating anything he’d spent time around alone. I called the police and filed a report, and reported the driver to Door Dash. I hate that I had to do this, because I know how hard it can be working a gig job, but I had no idea whether this person was going to attempt to harm me or someone else in my building. As I mentioned, he continued texting me. I texted him back, letting him know that, again, I was sorry for the inconvenience and that he appeared not to understand my explicit directions, and told him to please just put the food down and exit the building. Dude kept arguing with me via text, and I let him know, again, POLITELY, that he was inside of a high security building and that his behavior was on video, and that the police were coming. He then threatened to report me to the police. I said do what you have to do for your own safety, sir. Have a good rest of your day. Anyway...my question is this: is there some sort of an explanation for why he might have chosen to behave that way? Like...is there something I could’ve done differently, or that I should do differently in future?
Now, I’m a bit hesitant to order with that app, because I don’t want this guy showing up at my door. Any suggestions would be helpful, and just fyi, when I am having a good day health wise, I am always happy to meet my driver at the doors to my building, and I tip extremely well and am always really appreciative of what these folks do for me, so I’m really not sure what set this guy off so badly...","Some people just can’t handle working on their own. He must have been having a really bad day, but that’s no excuse to treat anyone like this. Contact DoorDash customer support and tell them what happened.

Banned from Upwork after called names for my disability,"I'm writing because I really need some help or advice.
I have type 1 bipolar disorder and I'm a drug and alcohol addict of 20 years. I've been living in sobriety / recovery for the last 15 months and the only job I've been able to hold down is as a freelancer on Upwork.
This week, I hired someone on Upwork to help me with some website work (for my mental health website where I help others) and the person I hired called me names when I asked for edits he didn't like. I fired him. Then he started taunting me by making comments about how he feels sorry for how bad my life is and my mental health. So I said some rude things to him.
When you struggle with mood disorders like mine, it's really hard sometimes to keep cool when that happens. I wasn't expecting to be taunted, and provoked like that and I responded poorly. But I was provoked about my disability that I can’t control sometimes.
I said nothing racist, nothing discriminatory, but then I got an email from Upwork saying I did something racist or discriminatory and I was banned forever from Upwork. My response to him telling me I had a terrible life because of my disease was to tell him he lives in a third world country. He later said a lot of things that didn’t make sense and I told him that his Upwork profile says he is fluent in English but that I can’t understand what he’s saying. I didn't handle it well, but I did NOT start this and I did NOT say anything racist as “Jast” in Upwork support claims. It's really hard making it in this world when you have to overcome mental illness and addiction and I really need a chance to have a second chance to feed my kids with this job on Upwork.","So basically you and the freelancer said dumb shit in Upwork's message rooms and you both got the axe.

Is it possible to ever consistently make around 10$ / hour ?,"Hi,
Thanks to a medical condition, I'll be spending a lot of time at home indefinitely..
Turking looks to be a great legal way to make money, but I worry that the pay is not worth it if you live in a first world country ? I mean; surely people living in a third world country are willing to do HITS for far less money then me, and therefore driving the price down ? ( witch is their good right to do so )
However a lot of Turkers seem to be living in the US ? Is it possible to make around 10 US $ / hour if you turk 8 hours a day, for about 6 months ? That would make it kinda worth while for me...
Also: although my English is reasonable (and will likely improve when Turking a lot), am not a native English speaker.. and I don't know if that's a big disadvantage ?",">people living in a third world country are willing to do HITS for far less money then me
Amazon has stopped allowing new non-US accounts for a couple years now and a large amount of HITs require a US location qualification.
>Is it possible to make around 10 US $ / hour if you turk 8 hours a day, for about 6 months?
It's possible, whether or not it's possible for you personally depends on a lot of factors like computer proficiency, work ethic, and how quickly you learn the ropes.
>although my English is reasonable (and will likely improve when Turking a lot), am not a native English speaker.. and I don't know if that's a big disadvantage ?
You may have to avoid certain tasks that require native English speakers, but they warn you about that up front. You can also return any tasks you feel are too complicated or not suited for your skillset. The silver lining is some tasks are looking for non-native speakers, and depending on what your native language is, you could also find yourself making decent earnings on translation and other tasks requiring your mother tongue.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/2umxxo/is_it_possible_to_ever_consistently_make_around/,mturk,"""medical condition""|""medical issue""",2umxxo,2015-02-03,1,5,Dr-Maximum,1,,neutral,1,suitability,neutral,Agree,1,Agree,neutral,1,,,,1,,,,1,,,,1,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
Drivers with Disabilities,"Hi /s/uber,
I'm planning to cut back to part-time & freelance for my primary job, & I was considering driving for Uber as an occasional change of pace - I enjoy driving, & am a bit of a social creature, so it seems like a cool thing to pick up for a day or two on slow weeks. I use a wheelchair due to a Spinal Cord Injury 18 years ago. I'm fully licensed, have professionally-engineered hand controls, & once I'm in my car I have no barriers to driving safely. Essentially, the only way to tell I have a disability is from seeing my hands operating the hand controls. I meet all requirements (newer car, background check, etc). By law & de facto, my disability does not impact on my ability to drive so long as my license conditions are met (automatic transition & modified vehicle). The only thing I can foresee that I'm unable to do is anything requiring the driver to be outside the vehicle (helping with luggage, etc).
* Is there anything which asserts that Uber drivers *must* be able to leave the vehicle?
* Is it required that a driver be able & willing to help with luggage etc?
* Can you think of any reason why I'd be less able to perform the inherent duties of the job?
* Are there any drivers that you know of in a similar situation?
* `NEW` My chair takes up most of the boot of my car. Would I be required to make that space available to rides for their luggage?
* `NEW` Are drivers able to advertise (in platform) as ""no luggage"" or similar?","I don't think helping toss someone's 50lb suitcase in the trunk is a requirement. I know drivers that don't help people. They pull up, see they have luggage, and just pop the trunk from the driver's seat. Even though we get shit wages, and it more than likely won't lead to a tip, I help every single time because people are lazy and will just drag their bags across my bumper and damage it. Don't let the fear of tossing bags deter you.

My tips for new UberEats drivers. Immediate tips guaranteed!,"Greetings,
So you have a car, don't want a boss, and want to find some alternative income by driving for UberEats. I have been driving for Uber for about 10 hours now and want to share my expertise with you. With my tips, you will be guaranteed high dollar tips and ratings. Have no fear, I is here!
1) Don't look the customer in the eye - When you arrive at the customer location. Whether you're delivering to a car or a door, avoid all contact with the customer when they approach you. This lets the customer retain dominance over you and they will surely prefer that. 2) Learn the ritual dances of other countries - Many times while driving with UberEats, you will have to deliver foreign food. While the order is being prepared, it is customary to perform the ritual dances of the culture in question. Not doing so may seem disrespectful to the business owner and result in poor ratings. If the customer ordered say Chinese for example, you should bow to them multiple times during the drop off to show your respect for their culture stolen by their choices in food.
3) State random facts about Uber why you're late - When you gotta go, you gotta go. Sometimes that can make us late to pick up orders or indulging in massive amount of doobs out back by the dumpster with some hood rats. Regardless of the reason you're running late, simply tell the customer their address is wrong on the GPS, maybe a tree was in the way, and that Uber has been making WAY too many changes as of late. They'll understand. 4) Customer delivery notes are optional - When a customer has written ""deliver to the door"" they did not state how right? To save time and not get out of the car ... Imagine the old game paperboy. If you have decent aim, just chuck that shit at their door.
5) Take all condiments you can carry - Whether you have a delivery for Taco Bell or McDonalds, the napkins, sauces, and plastic spoons, are all free. Whether the customer wants them or not, fill the bag to the brim. Anything that spills out is yours to keep. If the staff says ""Everything is in the bag!"" Just say, ""With Uber, we have higher standards"" and walk out.
6) Become disabled - Before making contact with the customer, you must have your act thought out for whatever disability is most popular at the time. Think Leo Dicaprio with 200 chromosomes. Which act is the most relatable to the customer? Dox the customer's social media account and police records to find a disability in their family. This will allow the customer to relate to you more and want to become supportive with a high tip. Sympathy is the keyword here.
Well, I hope these tips help you newcomers to UberEats driving. Remember, to apply yourself. Most people here on reddit constantly complain and whine because they just aren't working hard enough. Unlike them, think outside the box. Then think about what it is like inside the box, but looking outwards.",They had us in the first half not gonna lie,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/d0rptj/my_tips_for_new_ubereats_drivers_immediate_tips/,UberEATS,disability,d0rptj,2019-09-07,28,16,datguy__dev,0,,,0,facetious advice,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"My account was hacked last night, any idea how this could have happened? and how I can protect myself in the future?","Last night I was at arather large mall in NC. On my way to the parking lot my phone rang- it was a Lyft driver asking where I am as they can't find me. I was like ""Huh? I didn't call for a driver."" They asked me ""Are you iamjustjenna?"" I said yes. The driver said someone using my number called for a Lyft. Now I do have family sharing on my account but my son lives in the Pacific North West and has his own car. Anyway, I checked - it wasn't him. And at any rate, the rider had requested a ride from the very same mall I was currently at. The driver was kind and empathetic and said he would cancel the ride and report it. I got off the phone and tried to call Lyft support (which doesn't exist apparently, they will only talk to you via email). However, for the next half hour, my phone kept blowing up with Lyft notifications stating the next driver was on the way. And so for the next half hour I had to call each driver, explain what was happening and have them cancel/report the ride. In the meantime, my husband who was sitting next to me in our car (we were parked) was trying to remove our credit card from the Lyft app - it would not let us. It stated that we could not remove the only working payment method on the account. (FYI. he also logged into our Uber account and THEY allowed us to remove all payment methods.) Eventually I was able to get my Lyft account deleted,3 but not until we were home. I had to sit in the parking lot canceling rides until the hacker gave up. I don't understand how this happened. My phone carrier doesn't think my phone was cloned as no other strange activity occurred, no calls or texts were made that I didn't make myself, no international calls, etc. I canceled my debit card but not until this morning and no activity was made on it between 8:30 last night and this morning.I also changed my email password and enabled two step authenticator - just in case. And I have had the same phone number for fifteen years...
Any ideas or thoughts on what happened? I'm actually kinda sad I had to delete my Lyft account. I do feel lucky though that I caught this before it got out of control. I would have hated to wake up to hundreds of dollars of charges, especially since my husband and I are living on disability and work men's compensation at the moment. So a huge thank you to that first driver who alerted me to what was happening and saved me a great deal of money. If I knew how to contact him, I would Venmo him a large tip just for being a compassionate person and telling me what steps to take.
P.S Lyft, screw you for not allowing me to put an immediate freeze on my account, or letting me remove my card from the platform. If luck hadn't been on my side last night I could have been in a world of financial hurt. Because of this I will not be reactivating my account, regardless of changed passwords and replaced debit cards.","This usually happens to people who reuse passwords.
You used one website that got breached and the password for that account was stolen. Hackers then try that password on other services to see what they can get into. Since so many people reuse passwords this is very effective. You can check out [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see what breaches you're in. To stop this from happening you need to stop reusing passwords.

Less than Minimum wage? - doordash vs. grubhub and more,"I work at Grubhub but haven't been able to get a schedule because of 1 week when I tried refusing offers just to see if it was better that way and now, a month later, I'm still paying for it. 2 weeks after my week of refusing about half of my offers, I was no longer able to schedule on Thursdays and had to wait til Saturday mornings, which left nothing. So I applied for Doordash. There is no minimum hourly income even if you are on a schedule. The small income earned from dash barely covers gas used during deliveries. The tax that will be taken out of that small amount left, leaves almost nothing. I'm racking up a tax bill, lowering the value and life of my car, and putting my license and safety at risk by needlessly being on the road, increasing the likelihood of accidents and tickets. I already got a traffic ticket cause didn't see a stop sign cause I didn't know where I was and became nervous.
I started this kind of work cause my anxiety is too high to work around people. I need an income but instead I'm racking up bills. I'm so frustrated I don't know what to do. I have a medical condition that makes normal stuff impossible and I thought I found a way around this problem. I guess I'm venting, looking for suggestions.. I want to know how I can make money doing this or if there is a better job that is similar. Also what is up with GrubHub keeping my acceptance rate low a month later? This week I changed my status to accepting offers just so I could accept an offer so that my rate will be 100% this week. I know they count the last 30 days, but my rate was 74% a month ago and hasn't changed in a month, not by even 1%. I sent them an email with no response.
Are there better companies I should try?","What city are you in? Look into postmates and cavair. Postmates you online and offline as you wish.

Doordash' legal liabilities,"So I wanted to know, based on anecdotal and other evidence, if other dashers think doordash will have their day of reckoning in court or with states. I'll mention a few things I have seen, tell me if you agree/disagree or can add your own..
1) What happens when a delivery occurs to someone with a food allergy, let's assume for a moment, that like an average Dasher, you use the same bag for all foods, same hands, same car) and your handling had enough of the allergen to cause something severe. The restaurant won't be held liable because they didn't serve tainted food. They put the dots together, and realize food is NOT handled safely. To avoid this, during onboarding doordash could issue food licensing cards. https://www.ansi.org/accreditation/credentialing/certificate-issuers/food-handler-certificates/
They don't. 2) What happens when a driver is injured on the job (not including car wrecks because they have liability insurance, I suppose)? 3) Uncle Sam. Here is what the IRS defines as ""an employee vs contractor"":
You are not an independent contractor if you perform services that can be controlled by an employer (what will be done and how it will be done). This applies even if you are given freedom of action. What matters is that the employer has the legal right to control the details of how the services are performed.
If an employer-employee relationship exists (regardless of what the relationship is called), you are not an independent contractor and your earnings are generally not subject to Self-Employment Tax.
While doordash could say employees can ""choose"" this is not true, they specifically increase pay during certain times, which is a thinly veiled way of increasing employees available during those times. They also control how, you must drive, you must use red card, you must use hot bag...the list goes on. So eventually IRS WILL catch on to this.
3a) let's assume an employee-employer relationship DOES exist, I think their most recent update is an attempt at transparency when it comes to tip theft, I see this as an attempt on their part to call drivers ""tip employees""
This is what the us dept of labor says regarding tip employees:
A tipped employee engages in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 per month in tips. An employer of a tipped employee is only required to pay $2.13 per hour in direct wages if that amount combined with the tips received at least equals the federal minimum wage. If the employee’s tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 per hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. Many states, however, require higher direct wage amounts for tipped employees.
Imo they don't meet this standard. 3b) the FSLA requirement for drivers. Used to be, rules only applied if you were driving 10000 lbs and over, but now applies to all persons engaging in a ""safety affecting activities"" (e.g. driving) - I believe in California at least, employees would need an overtime exemption card or be paid for any overtime over 40 hours. https://www.overtime-flsa.com/overtime-fairpay-rules/
4) The ADA - doordash makes no accommodation for disabled drivers. One might argue that physical ability might exclude them from the job, but it could be a mental disability, it could be a physical one, that if a reasonable accommodation was made, could be performed. Since doordash can deactivate you if you have consistently late or low ratings, and one could prove this was in relation to their impairment, and doordash has made no attempt at accommodation, I would say this is a plausible scenario. These are what I can think of off the top of my head. Got angry just doing research for it. All the gig services are breaking the rules, not playing fair, and no one is saying anything because we NEED those gig services. But I do think any number of the regulatory agencies or laws will eventually reckon with doordash and others: OSHA, dept of labor, dept of industrial affairs, IRS, FSLA act, FMLA act, ADA act,",Man im lookin forward to that $39 ill get whenever a class action is finally settled.,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/bwqrdh/doordash_legal_liabilities/,doordash,disability,bwqrdh,2019-06-04,0,14,kbrackson,1,ADA applicability for disabled drivers,n,1,"legality, lack of accommodations for disabled drivers",n,Agree,1,Agree,n,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Anyone ever verify tips?,"It's a sneaking suspicion of mine, but then again I have an anxiety disorder so who knows. My suspicion started when a nice old lady told me she would tip me $5 for my trouble, and later on I see the tip was $4 and change. The time delay makes me suspicious as well, as the only reason I see that we aren't told quickly what our tip is is so that we can't talk to the customer about it. I've told a couple people say they will tip in the app only to never tip, and although these customers I understand are very likely to just be lying, it does add to me wondering if PostMates skims off the top of our tips sometimes.
I really appreciate any tip, high or low, but I wonder if there would be some way to verify if the $4.65 cent tip I got on a exactly $30.00 order is really what the customer tipped. I myself when going out, tip in whole dollar amounts ($4.00, $5.00, $6.00, etc), or I tip in a way that my total amount is even ($24.60 bill so I tip $5.40 for a final total of $30.00, for example).
Probably just me being very r/conspiracy , but wanted to throw my suspicions out there in case anyone feels the same.",This is the problem with these services being so secret!

“He canceled my ride when I texted him. Letting him know I would be out I was getting out the door when he left. My schedule time for pick up is 5:30 to 5:40am. He said sorry which was great but made excuses for why he left saying that a lot of customers “end up not coming out and it wastes his time and he loses money on rides at this time that good rides.” I let him know the driver I had yesterday waited for me even though I had to end up using rest room before I left because things happen when you gottta go to the rest room lol not like you can control your blatter. He asked if I was upset at him leaving. I said yes “I was upset” then he decided to threaten me saying that I he was just going to drop me off and stop my ride ride before my destination just because he “Assumed I was going to give him a bad rating” I told him I wasn’t going to I actually was going to let it go and have a good day today and he insisted to get angry and said “ I called him a jerk which I did not he said well you basically did since you said the driver yesterday didn’t leave you when you let him know you had to rest room so please wait. He went on to complaining why he did what he did and when it comes to customers and being threatened about dropping them off when they need to get to work at random spot where there destination is isn’t okay. It’s very scarey and I understand he has to feed his kids and he said well if I knew you weren’t like how you said you were and not cancel I would of never done it. It’s very hurtful to treat ppl like this. Especially if someone is going through depression or aniexty or has a disability but look normal for a driver to treat someone so poorly. It’s very rude. I truly didn’t want to give him a bad rating I have an extra star for trying to turn it around.

Let's be honest for a minute. Ridesharing is inherently racist. What are some ways to fix this?,"It is obvious that people of color are not benefiting from the platforms in the same way that white folks are. These are the people who most need transportation in order to get and keep jobs, go to school, better and lift themselves from poverty. At the same time, they live in the worst neighborhoods, their cities have abandoned them, and public transportation is severely lacking. Let's bridge the gap and give them the **transportation transformation they deserve!** What are some good ways to promote equity in this space? Here are some of my own thoughts: • For example, Lyft shows profile pictures to drivers, leading to canceled trips due to skin color. Thankfully Uber does not do this • Ratings are racist. Say it again: RATINGS ARE RACIST. It is nearly impossible for a person of color to maintain a high-enough rating through hundreds of trips simply because prejudiced drivers will always rate 1-star for color. A certain percentage of drivers will be bigoted, depending on market. Chicago has banned ratings and this has improved access to ridesharing tremendously. Let's work together to get rid of this feature • Many people of color who live in poor neighborhoods are unable to afford ridesharing. We need a two- (or more) tiered system, where pricing is based on income or disability, similar to public transit reduced fares. If somebody is on disability or Medicaid, they should pay half the fare. Denying transportation access to poor people of color will just perpetuate their situation • Requiring credit or debit cards in order to register and use the platforms is another example of racial injustice. Many of these folks are unbanked, and the only way for them to pay is cash or other monetary instruments, such as vouchers and public transit tickets. Ridesharing drivers should be able to accept all of these and in the case of bus/train tickets, they would simply exchange them for cash at the local public transport authority's offices. Thank you for fighting racism, for being open-minded and open to the world, and for keeping less-privileged people of color in your thoughts. Feel free to contribute more ideas and honest discussion about this issue. Once we can collectively agree on the measures needed, I will send them off to VPs and inclusion officers at both Uber and Lyft with whom I've been communicating.

A certain percentage of drivers will be bigoted, depending on market. Chicago has banned ratings and this has improved access to ridesharing tremendously. Let's work together to get rid of this feature • Many people of color who live in poor neighborhoods are unable to afford ridesharing. We need a two- (or more) tiered system, where pricing is based on income or disability, similar to public transit reduced fares. If somebody is on disability or Medicaid, they should pay half the fare. Denying transportation access to poor people of color will just perpetuate their situation • Requiring credit or debit cards in order to register and use the platforms is another example of racial injustice. Many of these folks are unbanked, and the only way for them to pay is cash or other monetary instruments, such as vouchers and public transit tickets. Ridesharing drivers should be able to accept all of these and in the case of bus/train tickets, they would simply exchange them for cash at the local public transport authority's offices. Thank you for fighting racism, for being open-minded and open to the world, and for keeping less-privileged people of color in your thoughts. Feel free to contribute more ideas and honest discussion about this issue. Once we can collectively agree on the measures needed, I will send them off to VPs and inclusion officers at both Uber and Lyft with whom I've been communicating.

Landscape for Uber app?,"A relative is using Uber these days, and due to a disability she has a real problem typing on the typical 4.5 to 5.5 inch smartphones in portrait mode. She's okay with the landscape keyboard in other apps that rotate, but Uber doesn't do that. She will usually be going to the same few places. I would like to program those destinations in advance, but Uber doesn't allow that.
Finally, it would be very handy to be able to schedule a trip in advance. It could be something stored on the device, for example the night before an early morning trip. Then the device sounds a warning 20-25 minutes before a departure. The rider confirms the ride with one press and the request gets transmitted.
Any or all of these would reduce the stress my relative feels when she needs a ride. Instead, she has to interrupt getting ready to leave, to type on a tiny keyboard in a limited time frame.","If she has an Android device she can download an app called Ultimate Rotation Control. In the app you can force any app you want into landscape mode. You can set it up to always open the app in landscape.

Just some tips to strengthen your spine.,"You don't have to do anything other than take pax from point A to point B *as long as they remain respectful*
People who are obnoxious about aux cords and USB cables never tip anyways, save yourself the trouble of hurting your ears with frivolous ""music"" (I swear, people with good taste in music never ask for an aux cord lol) Just say **NO** to trap. Should be on a sticker.
If you really want tips all you gotta do is keep a clean car, respectfully converse with those who wish to (well, more like make them talk about themselves), keep silent with those who don't and drive peacefully. People who ask you for extra favors WILL NOT tip you 90% of the time, so straight up hustle with them. Straight up ask for cash to: go to the drive thru, wait for more than 2 minutes for their friend, stop at the liquor store, either keep heading towards their destination or end the trip and bail the moment they try and argue. Never forget that they're not paying for any of that and don't be afraid of reminding them (in a friendly manner of course) and most definitely don't let any pushover here tell you otherwise.
My personal pet peeve is being called buddy or Bob. I simply return the favor or act dumb ""oh I'm not here for Bob, wrong Uber"" lol, and if they don't like it, that's how you know they didn't mean it in a friendly manner, but were trying to set a dynamic that favors them. Most people who will refer to you that way are trying to prime you to make you their bitch, don't fall for it, it's a common psychological trick, try it on girls lol
Also, don't forget you can kick anyone out for any non-discriminating reason. So don't put up with any sort of disrespect. If they won't get out, call 911, tell them where your next pick up is and how your last ride is seems to be on ""some sort of drug"" and refuses to exit the vehicle. I guarantee you paxhole will make a run for it at the first stop sign lol
Finally, if you're not a WAV nor an Assist, you don't have to act like one. If you wanna be Johnny on the spot, well good for you, Jesus loves you lol But you don't have to and no, it's not against the ADA, the ADA is clear on this: offer the exact same service to the disabled, make reasonable and feasible accomodations. Handling the elderly while not being trained to do so is unreasonable. Enough said about that.
Moving on to service animals, I just cancel and bail the moment I see the dog lol Never had an issue, but I'm ready to tell them I had to take an emergency shit; no one questions diarrhea. Am I an asshole for doing so? Well, I'm gonna catch some flak for this one, but how about they do whatever the fuck they did before Uber? I don't think a disability gives you the right to inconvenience others that way. I mean they pay the exact same but then you gotta spend time picking up hairs and cleaning the dirt/mud off your upholstery. Fuck that noise. This is how you stay sane and make money doing this.

How do you decide when to take a chance working for someone new?,"I've been doing mostly surveys, but after doing a bunch of reading in here, I decided to branch out into batches. I'm struggling to balance risk vs reward, and would really appreciate some input from y'all. I recently passed a test to work on a batch that for me has an effective rate of ~$13/hr. SUPER EXCITING for me; I felt like I'd just won Christmas, Valentine's Day, and the Super Bowl. Then I went a little crazy. I submitted a lot of HITs. A LOT. Like, if he rejects them all, my % drops from 99.8 to 97.4.
But.
Thanks to a car accident, I recently became the primary wage earner here. Which is super fun, because I hadn't worked for realsies since 2014. I'm disabled, but too stubborn to apply for disability. I'd just earned a little bit here and there to cover gas for my caregivers to drive me to doctor's appointments, or something special from the grocery store beyond what food stamps cover. Then my primary caregiver goes and totals the car, and loses his job because it requires physical labor, which he can't do with a broken arm. He's got unemployment, but it's a pitiful amount. So the bills are on me now.
All that is to say, I really need the money. ~$13 an hour is kickass money for me right now. So I want to keep going on this batch. But I'm also afraid that if the guy turns out to be a jerk, it's going to tank my numbers. TO isn't much help; the ratings are all about previous HITs that paid less and involved different work. His AA is 7 days. I'm worried that if I wait that long, the rest of the batch will be gone, and I'll have missed a golden opportunity.

"New Dasher, looking for clarity","I never knew how large and vibrant the DoorDash community is, and I’m proud to be a part of it! Me and my partner are a expecting a baby due at the end of the year. The pregnancy has been pretty difficult, and my partner needed surgery to prevent miscarriage. We’ve had some scary moments where we thought we lost our baby. She was forced to quit her job for a part time position. I am a disabled veteran with a permanent and total disability. I went to the Veterans Affairs to make sure I can get a part time job. Someone who knows my situation recommended doordash and other delivery apps, mainly because of the very flexible work hours. I got approved for doordash and instacart. Still waiting on postmates, and lyft. The biggest concern is the rating system and deactivation. I’m realizing after 5 deliveries that there are things that are out of my control, but I can somehow still be blamed for it. I wanted to know how other dashers deal with the ratings system. Should I find ways to improve my percentages? Or should I just ignore them and just try to do my best? Any advice would be appreciated.","I am on SSD so can make some extra and tips do not count towards it.
I will give you some tips to help.
1) Don't take less than $1 a mile
2) Get an ETA from the store and text the customer that you arrived and give them the ETA and then you will be on your way.
3) Get a larger and better heat bag, Walmart for $5, keeps things hot, it is for holding cold drinks but holds most pizzas and large bags.
4) Dress nicely and smile.
5) Verify the customers order with staff, I usually just ask them to look at my phone, I think some read, some don't give a fuck, but they have caught things they missed, but also look at it, some things are obvious, they missed the soda. Make sure you have napkins, ketchup for the fries, soy sauce for their sushi and chopsticks. etc...
I tell customers I verified their order, napkins, straws etc are in the bag, thank them and have a nice day.
That is just the way I work with over 400 DD deliveries and have a 4.93, your first hundred a low rating will hurt and look bad. I was at like 4.6something before I got into my groove.
6) If I can't find their house in 15 seconds I call them, they do not want to watch you on GPS sitting in your car for a minute, they are hungry it is like 20 minutes to them or driving around the block.
Ignore the on time rating, it's out of your control anyways, and don't hesitate to decline orders.

So I swipe begin delivery so I can call the guy with the intention of then calling support to have them cancel. He says he doesn't care, not to cancel the food. He says he has a medical issue and can't leave the house and tells me if I'll bring him some beer he'll tip me huge in cash. So I get the beer, drive the few miles to house, he pays me for the beer (plus an extra $5), gives me $20 cash and tells me to swipe delivered so I get paid for the food too.

Is there supposed to be a place to rate your driver?,"It's really weird. I'm a new customer. I'm disabled and can't drive, so it's good to be able to get stuff delivered - I mean, even disabled people deserve to be able to get some fast food or a restaurant meal or whatever, not to even mention the other stuff that can be ordered this way when shipping would take too long.
Anyway, I just did my second order today and confirmed I'm totally not crazy: there was nowhere to rate the driver. I could see my driver's ratings each time when they were on their way to me, but I wasn't given the option to give them a rating. I gave the tip and went to the next screen where it asks you to give the restaurant a thumbs up or down, and that was it. I even tried scrolling up and down on each page in case it was hidden. The first time I blamed myself and thought I messed up, because I am visually disabled and it can be hard, and sometimes the app coding trips things up too. But, this time I literally did the blind bat holding it up close to my face thing to make sure my driver got their deserved five stars, and there was nothing. I wish now that I'd taken a screenshot, but I didn't think of it.
What's up with this? Is it some deeply hidden thing, or is my app just whacko?

Is the 18+ requirement in the TOS legal?,"After replying to a comment from u/holierthanthee where he said to provide the actual statute prohibiting giving rides to minors, I couldn't find one in Duluth or Minneapolis or Wisconsin (although I was sure I had seen it - I must have been reading something else at the time). What I did find was this in Duluth:
Section 47-56. Discrimination, refusal to transport orderly person prohibited; accessibility.
(a) No TNC driver shall refuse to transport any orderly person or persons.
(b) The TNC shall adopt a policy of non-discrimination on the basis of destination, race, color, national origin, religious belief or affiliation, sex, disability, **age**, sexual orientation, or gender identity with respect to riders and potential riders and notify TNC drivers of such policy. Minneapolis (Ordinance chapter 343.10):
(n) TNC drivers shall not (4) Refuse to convey an orderly passenger And then in Wisconsin:
440.45 (2) A participating driver may not discriminate against any
passenger or prospective passenger on the basis of destination,
race, color, national origin, religious belief or affiliation, sex, disability,
**age**, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
If I read this in plain English, it says you can't refuse to give rides to anyone on the basis of their age. It doesn't have an exemption for minors. Minneapolis doesn't specifically say you can't deny based on age, but since you can't refuse service to any orderly passenger, you would first have to prove that the 16 year old going home from an after school job is a disorderly passenger.
I'm not a lawyer at all and I don't pretend to be one, but it really doesn't look like it's legal to deny service because the passenger is a minor. Yes, I know the language is very similar to some other age discrimination laws which only apply to 40+, but there's no limitation on age in any of the three laws I looked at (I checked the definitions sections of all three which is typically where the weirdness happens).","OP

Is restaurant or driver responsible for missing items?,"Frequent customer right now as I am unable to drive while recovering from a medical issue. I have had the same driver, “Nancy,” a number of times and just love her. I tend to order from ethnic restaurants and Nancy has often asked me about them, as she is (no offense) elderly and seems pretty sheltered. The restaurant workers at the places I’m thinking of speak little English. Twice recently I have ordered an entree plus a side item and have received my order without the side. For example, tonight I ordered Ramen with a side of marinated tofu. The ramen came in about 15 separate containers (broth plus all ingredients). The regular tofu was there but not the marinated. I don’t expect Nancy to know that my food was supposed to come with one type of tofu and she should be expecting two tofus. With that said, I am irritated I paid $4 for something I didn’t get. Does Nancy get in trouble if I report the missing item? I’m guessing the easiest solution is to just never get a modified order delivered. But dang that marinated tofu is good...

Doesn’t matter because all three of those entities were not the delivery driver.

I do try to make sure I’m getting an appropriate amount of food and I do verify the order with the server or whatever staff person I talk to, however at the end of the day most of the bags are sealed and if they aren’t I don’t know what half the food is anyways the few times I do pry the containers apart and peek.

Welp I'm done for the night and not for a good reason,Welp for the first time in two years of juicing. I parked my car in a public and note free parking spot.

She's cute and dressed pretty well. Definitely doesn't want to talk, not having a good night. Not drunk though. About 4 minutes into the ride she asks me if I know of any places that are hopping tonight. Shit, I don't know. That place over there is usually pretty busy, but I haven't been around much tonight. She groans from the back seat. I just want to die. Ok, this got interesting. Why do you say that I ask. I went out with this guy tonight from match. His dick wouldn't even get hard. Ya know. I'm just so sick of going home. I hate going home. His fucking dick woulnd't get hard. I try to pick nice guys and always get losers. Hmm, well. That sucks, you're a pretty enough woman.

"Uber Driver ARE considered ""Employees"" in CA","I was hit from behind while on an active Uber drive in Los Angeles with a passenger. In addition to my crushed personal car, I also suffered extensive spinal injuries. The driver who hit me, BTW, was an unlicensed, uninsured 16-year-old girl who was joyriding her elderly grandfather's car. Obviously, I retained a PI attorney who filed a claim against James River and their $1M uninsured motorist policy, and had to beg and borrow to come up with the $1K deductible, even though the other driver was 100% at-fault. If I had an extra thousand bucks lying around, why would I being doing this crappy job in the first place?
But today, I also contacted an attorney friend who happens to be one of the most prominent Workers Comp attorneys in Los Angeles, thinking I had no case as Uber defines its drivers as ""independent contractors"" without Workers Comp benefits. He assured me, without any qualifiers, that, under current CA law, Uber drivers are classified as ""employees"" by the state Workers Comp Board, regardless of what Uber professes to the contrary.
He could not wait to set up a meeting with me Monday morning to do client intake and file a WC case against Uber's deep pockets, and I strongly encourage other Uber drivers injured on the job to consult with Workers Comp attorneys to see if they get similar responses. Your injuries do not even have to be the result of an accident, you could trip while exiting your car, or suffer back pain from too many hours driving--any medical issue you experience while on the job would qualify, whether or not you are on an active trip.
Why do you think Uber and Lyft have lobbied their drivers in California so hard to reach out to their representatives to repeal the Dynamex decision? It's certainly not for the drivers' benefit--it is because reclassifying drivers as employees exponentially increases their financial exposure. The rideshare companies can define us anyway they like, but the CA Workers Comp board apparently has a different definition, and they are the ones with the power to levy meaningful financial sanctions.
When you drive for Uber/Lyft, your are strongly (encouraged) to drive during specific times when boosts and bonuses apply, you are not given information about the destination of the trip you accept beforehand and, most importantly, your are penalized by both platforms when your acceptance percentage or cancellation rates fall below a certain level. That's called having a ""boss,"" not being ""independent.""","Let's set aside the idea of contractors vs. employees for a moment. The tide is already being bent towards employees by forces much more powerful than us. So, what does that mean practically speaking? New York gives us a clue.
[New Lyft rules have Uber steaming mad](https://outline.com/Sn55pw)
> Starting June 27, Lyft drivers will not be able to get onto the company's app if they are cruising where few people are demanding rides. Instead, they will have to wait until demand picks up, or drive to a busier neighborhood—Midtown, for example.
That is likely coming to California if [AB 5](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/30/18642535/california-ab5-misclassify-employees-contractors) passes. You may only be able to access the driver application from areas with high demand. Otherwise, the number of drivers allowed online will be highly restricted.

Unlike Waymo One users, Early Riders have to sign nondisclosure agreements and aren’t allowed to discuss the program.

I'm frustrated with Uber and its lack of features!,"I'm frustrated with uber. I have to use the service out of necessity because I don't have a car and I can't drive due to disability. When I can pay for it, it is more convenient to use such services than anything else, so I use it quite often. The problem is that Uber drivers can't find me, even after giving them detailed instructions. This is not entirely their fault though, but Uber's lack of features.
For example, I can't set a specific destination through the pinpoint feature on the map. They removed this feature and all they offer me are predetermined pickup locations in specific addresses, which in itself are lacking. This is a problem when you're in a huge building with many entrances. It seems to me that the feature comes and goes depending on location and hours. In some locations they never offer it. It would be way better to just offer it always as an option along with their current predetermined system. It is one of the main reasons why I switched to Lyft in the first place. They always offer me this option and I never have problems with drivers locating me in Lyft. The reason why I switched from Lyft back to Uber was because Lyft removed the 4 seater option. Now that they added it back I switched back to Lyft. I think another feature that would be useful is the ability to send pics to uber drivers. You know, to communicate our location better. At the end of the trip, for added privacy, all pics can get automatically erased. These are just a few things I see that can be better. Thanks for reading my post!
TL;DR : 1. Uber should have the pinpoint map feature always, without it many drivers can't find me. 2. We should have the ability to send pics to uber drivers to communicate our location better.","Sounds like you might have been requesting Pool rides those time there were ""predetermined"" pick up locations. I'm not sure since Pool isn't offered in my market, but for normal X trips riders can drag the pin if it doesn't already go to the right spot. There are several ways to enter the pick up spot. Not all riders are aware of all of these. 1) let the app determine your current location thru your phones GPS. 2) Manually enter address or business name. 3) Drop pin on a spot on the map in the app. The last is the least reliable. As additional assistance you can use the real time location feature. This adds a blue pin showing were your phone is (again from GPS). Not always accurate but it can really help sometimes.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/dmy8j6/im_frustrated_with_uber_and_its_lack_of_features/,uber,disability,dmy8j6,2019-10-25,1,6,your__dad_,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
My first month with Postmates,"On September 11, 2019 I had lost my home. I was fortunate that I was able to get a few of my only belongings and move out to California to stay with my only close friends. I did everything I could to find work. I traveled across county lines and could find nothing to no avail. I am still employed at my old retail job and have had two interviews and still was not given a position to work. I was turned on to the idea of trying out Postmates by my caring friend. I did everything I can to purchase a reliable vehicle on a tremendously high interest rate loan, since that was all that I could qualify for. I had purchased the best insurance policy; I had followed the guidelines from Postmates to a tee. From September 20th, 2019 until October 26th, 2019, I had worked every single day for Postmates. My day consisted of me waking up at 7:00AM and driving the entire day, supplementing my gas tank with my earnings throughout the day, and only returning to my friend's couch to sleep around 4:00AM. My motivation every day was paying my medical bills and having enough to save up for rent since I had to find my own place with my friend as a roommate. I have a terrible case of Major Depressive Disorder and anxiety that was only made treatable by a very expensive (1429.00 per month) dopamine D₂ receptor partial agonist that is not covered by most insurances. I rarely have an opportunity to take a break, because to take a break is to fall short of my financial needs daily. I was involved in an accident on Saturday, October 26th in Rancho Santa Margarita while I was on my 18th delivery of the day in my 15th hour of my shift. I was driving on a dimly lit road and I accidentally hit a parked car. My car insurance took a statement from me at the time of the incident and a day later they told me because I was delivering food, that my monthly insurance that cost me 200.00 dollars a month would not be covering my accident because they have an exclusion policy that states they don't have to. The insurance adjuster was kind enough to email me the policy if I had any other questions. My car sustained heavy damages to the right passenger side bumper area. I am pleased to admit that Postmates does cover the other party’s property, but they do not have any coverage for their ""independent contractor"" employee. I had followed their instructions for working for their company and I was left out in the cold. I will be evicted on the 10th if I do not come up with the income. The insurance company also towed my vehicle to a lot where they charge daily and I have an invoice with my name required to pick up my damaged car. I will run out of medication on the 14th of November. I had insurance. I followed every single rule. I was loyal to a single company and provided excellent service. Now I'm left with nothing but hope. It will currently cost 750 to recover my vehicle and 5750 for repairs to my vehicle and 1000 for rent so I may continue finding work that doesn’t require me to put 300 miles on my vehicle a day. Moving forward I plan on finishing my degree in Computer Science and dedicating my energy and time for a company that cares about the well-being of their employees and will do everything in their power to protect their employees including limiting the amount they are allowed to work.",Imma let you in on a little secret... you can never make money doing the right thing.,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/couriersofreddit/comments/dokezh/my_first_month_with_postmates/,couriersofreddit,disorder,dokezh,2019-10-28,0,6,Aviantei,1,,n,1,,n,Agree,1,Agree,n,,1,1,,,,1,maybe social support,,,1,,,,1,,0,1,1,0,0,0,1
I Rely on Ridesharing Services,"Hey r/uberdrivers
I wanted to take a moment and let you know that I appreciate you all. I have a medical condition and haven't driven for 8 years. Prior to Uber and Lyft's existence, I knew the Los Angeles bus system like the back of my hand, and would get just about anywhere and everywhere that way. Except, the bus sucks for lost of reasons and it isn't an efficient use of my time.
So, when a friend mentioned Uber and Lyft to me, I didn't waste a minute. I've been using Uber and Lyft since it's inception and have never looked back. I can count on one hand how many bad rides I've had. They were really extreme. >There was this one time when I was asking the driver to make a left into my driveway to drop me off safely. He didn't want to because ""traffic was bad"" and ""it was safer if I jaywalked across the busy street."" I held my ground and he reluctantly pulled into my apartment complex's driveway. > >It was kinda on a slope. Like usual, I politely thanked him for the ride and for making the left and got out. Unfortunately, the driver's heavy door slipped and slammed shut much, much harder than I would have like to have closed it myself. So, I slightly open it, say sorry, and gently close it. The driver then proceeds to grumble and I start to walk the 150 feet distance to my apartment door. He pulls out of the driveway and tails me as I walk up to my complex's main door all while yelling slurs and making death threats. Needless to say, that's the kind of thing you'll get 0 stars for from me. Or any other reasonable person would've rated that driver 0 too in those circumstances.
>And as much as I've had my terrible experiences, I've had my good ones too. There was this one time where I left my keys inside my uber and went to Santa Monica Pier. When I realized my phone was missing 30 minutes after drop off I called it from a stranger's line. My uber driver answered and he was walking around the pier trying to find me for 30 minutes to give it back. > >We met up by the parking lot, I had him drive me home, since I was done with the day and tipped him an additional $20 because that seemed like the right thing to do.
Anyway, I'm babbling now, but when it doesn't seem like it, know there is someone, somewhere who appreciates you as a driver.","You should have reported to Uber the driver who was ""yelling slurs and making death threats.""

I really appreciate your order and be safe.. hope to see you soon... now if the person doesn’t answer the phone then you’ll go up to the door and either ring the doorbell or knock if they don’t have one.. take a picture and wait in your car.. by this time you should have 2 mins left on your timer and if they don’t answer you swipe and leave... hope this helps for the people that have social anxiety or any type of social disorder... it’s ok to get mad but just remember to CONTROL YOURSELF SO YOU CAN FOCUS ON WHAT TO DO...

How would someone go about escalating a health and safety matter?,"approximately a week ago, i noticed multiple adult head lice on the headrest of the seat in my uber, i sent a picture of 2 the lice to uber, and informed the driver, he ensured me he'd make sure he immediately delouse his car. i have only his word that he did that, but no reason to doubt him, he seemed just as shocked and alarmed as I.
however a week later i have found baby lice pop up, either one i didnt notice got in my hair, or there were also eggs on the headrest (i didnt notice the lice till half way into a long trip) and some slightly larger ones in my own hair, and uber offers nothing but cookie butter responses.
with my hair length i need treatment, and new bed linens and other material stuff that has become potentially lousy, and every time i ask for some help with computerisation as i do not have the money for it at the time, uber ignores that portion of the question. i have reported it since the moment it happened, then the moment it effected me, but uber in app help either is incapable of understanding or just doesn't understand that its unacceptable to acquire a parasite from using a paid service.
if someone got hit by an uber and required paid medical treatment they would need to pay, i feel this is a medical condition, brought on by engaging their services and they are responsible for most if not all of the costs of treatment incurred to me, as it is not something i should reasonably expect to be on the lookout for.
i can provide photos, but i would rather not, as lice are disgusting and i dont think any of us want to see that. if requested i will upload the ones i found in the uber however.
theres also the matter that a parasite that was sucking someone elses blood then came into contact with me and interacted with mine, though the chances of anything coming of that are minuscule, its still an additional reason as to just how disgusting this is.","Uber support is nearly useless unless the issue issue is a serious safety issue.

Why doesn't my GF ever seen to make as much as me driving passengers vs me doing eats?,"Hello, My girlfriend and i live in Dallas tx and have been driving for Uber for about a year each.She has been trying to get on disability for a while now due to various reasons, amputations of toes due to diabetes, sciatica,neck and back injuries,the list goes on,anyways her case worker said she is allowed to Uber while she awaits judgment on a if she's approved for ssi or not,allowing her to still be somewhat self sufficient. So here's the deal,
-We both leave on uberX/pool/eats preferences when we go out. -We usually try to work 3 or 4 hours at a time when we go out,usually at early morning and early evenings.
-she will only make about half or a third even of what I make in the same time!Not to mention sitting for hours in a ""busy area,trip soon"" and getting nothing.
-Both platinum status,but she was downgraded to gold when sickband couldn't work,but no real change in rides.
Lately I've only been doing Uber eats because I seem to do better at that, while she has left on all three preferences and she never seems to get surges,bonuses,ect. And her promotions look different as well.
For instance,her app may say drive three trips for $12 extra bonus for a couple days while mine may say 1.5-1.9x bonus between these hours. Also surge areas are non existent on her app while I always seem to get a surge downtown Dallas during dinner hours or late weekends of 1-3$. I make enough driving for Uber, Amazon flex,and day trading,but she is getting very discouraged and id hate to see her fail or worse even lose her car(I won't let that happen),which is all she has,bc most her family has passed away long ago and she has noone to help her.
She has talked to support and they have said there are no issues with her app, connectivity,nor any restrictions on her account.
Lately she's been going out more than me but I can still snatch a dinner surge on eats for 3 hours like I did tonight and make $60 while she's only at $20 and that's just gas for her to try again tomorrow.
Any tips?is there something I'm missing,she's convinced Uber doesn't like women and pays them less after I made a joke about it.
Any female anons out there wanna compare thier earnings to some of our male drivers?
Is there any legal recourses I should be looking into if so?
Like tonight I worked eats 2 hrs 50 mins for $60 bucks for instance,five eats trips $20 of it in tips.
She has worked the same and made like $20","I noticed I got more trips if I set my filters to just do eats or uberX.

I really thought this would be a game-changer for me, but reading your guys' posts I can't help but feel guilty for how shitty instacart treats its shoppers.

Trying to get started,"I’ve made it through the application process, but am having some hesitations about getting going due to the rating system. How likely do you think it is for someone new to flunk out due to poor ratings? I left my last job due to the high performance stress and was hoping to find some relief in picking my own hours, but now I’m feeling a bit of anxiety over not performing well enough in this line of work. To clarify I also have social anxiety disorder and that is another daily hurdle to cross/maintain, but I have been working through that issue for a long time now and know that exposure is ultimately the best way forward. I really want this to work out and be accessible work that I enjoy doing, but I keep overthinking the ratings. The last job I had that was interacting with the public was bagging groceries as a teenager and, shockingly, I didn’t really like the very vocal rejection I would get from making an easy mistake. So, to wrap this up, how harshly do people tend to rate you? I worry about how long I’ll be able to do this for and if I’ll have to put in a lot of effort aside from time management and minimal communication.",Honestly a couple times that I got rated poorly is because I stretch myself too thin and I realized that. I took two orders and didn’t check to see what the items were until it was too late to drop it. A lot of them were custom items such as Christmas candy Christmas toys etc. and it was two days before Christmas so I had to do a lot of service and it ran me behind on both orders.

[There are suits pending on this issue](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/21/uber-disability-laws-don-t-apply-to-us.html), but I think we would all 0refer a free market solution to this problem. I've been complaining about this for a while, but have found that most people who aren't personally effected simply don't care, so I decided to come up with my own solution. Currently Uber offers voluntary ADA compliance training, but customers have no way of knowing which drivers have undergone this training and therefore which drivers are safe to use. I have a low cost solution to this problem, but no way of suggestion it to anyone with any influence at Uber/Lyft. I would like to get in contact with Damien Hooper-Campbell (Global Diversity and Inclusion Lead at Uber) and/or his Lyft equivalent to personally suggest my solution. Currently ride shares have some bad publicity. And I'm sure either would jump on a chance to have some cheap good will news stories.","There isn't a phone number published anywhere for either company. Most correspondence is through e-mail. A physical address is listed so it would be possible to send snail mail. I have helped a a good number of sight impaired people when out driving. This includes those with dogs. Uber has sent out e-mails to inform drivers that we are required by law to make every reasonable attempt to accommodate. Are there drivers who don't comply? Yes. There are always going to be some bad apples out there. I've also read about instances of muslim drivers not wanting dogs in their cars. I'm not actually sure how to address this specific issue, but hopefully the driver is caring enough to help arrange another driver. The only instance where I might not be able to help someone is if they had a wheelchair or scooter. I can say that there are services in Denver that are capable of helping these individuals. In this circumstance it would be unreasonable to require all Uber drivers to use a handicap van with a ramp. Edit : I just read the article and if a person has a wheel chair that is compact, the yes they should be helped. I didn't mean to come off as insensitive, I apologize. I forgot that there are chairs that do collapse. I would agree that drivers could use sensitivity training, but this would also cross a line between drivers being independent contractors and being employees.

He Had a Stroke -- My Uber Story,"*Hi everyone, I am an Uber driver who likes to share my stories from the road. I find we see so many interesting things in a day and meet such interesting people. Driving has certainly helped restore some of my faith in humanity as I find the vast majority of riders are kind and have great life experience to share. I know we always seem to hear about the horrible riders that cause us grief, but I think there is a positive light out there for drivers that very few people get to see.* **He Had a Stroke**
I generally don’t get the chance to drive in the morning, but when I do, I find people are generally just going about their business. To a meeting, to school, back from the train station. You get the picture. Today was different when I was pinged by the app to go pickup at the hospital. A middle-aged gentleman was already waiting outside, which I always appreciate. The uncertainty of driving for an app is always put at ease when a friendly face is standing there waiting for you. The human connection is always nice to see and I much prefer it to a computer telling me when and where to show up.
We started to talk about the weather. The art of small talk is something I believe I have mastered, but my most interesting rides are always the ones that go far past these social norms. The conversation turned sharply as he said that he did not get to see much of the winter this year. My mind rushed to a long-term winter escape. Florida perhaps. So, silly me, I asked away.
“Did you get away for the winter? Lucky you!”.
“No, unfortunately not. I was in the hospital. You see, I had a stroke”.
Knowing very little about strokes or really what to even say, I wished him well in his recovery. We chatted about life, the recovery time, the agony of the doctor’s uncertainty. When could he return to work? Is this even in the cards any more? His entire being had changed in one moment. I suppose life is just a string of how we are doing today, this week, this month, this year. We forget how terrible it used to be when we struggled with a situation or event. With a medical issue, the loss of your first boyfriend or girlfriend, or even how shitty homework was to do in high school. Humans forget too easily and perhaps this is a helpful coping mechanism.

I picked up a passenger today, a middle age man, who had been going through a myriad of health issues from immunosuppression to late stage cancer, who had recently had a stroke. I went down the list and at least one family member I'm close to also suffered from one of his issues, so for our 15 minute ride, he just talked about how he was doing and how nice it was to have someone who knew something about it, instead of someone just trying to be polite.

"Has something changed in Orange County, CA?","I take it most people here are drivers for DoorDash. I've been using the service around since it started in Orange County, CA and have found it wonderful, especially since I'm disabled and don't get to go out to have interesting food that often. I post 5 stars to restaurant and driver almost every time.
Within the past six months or so, though, it seems like every other order is an issue. Either the driver floats away and they or DD lie to me about it (""the restaurant didn't make your order"" the chat help guy claims...then I call the restaurant and the food is sitting right there while no driver had actually showed up) or the driver is 20 minutes late and can't seem to account for why their car was sitting in a parking lot for 10 minutes, or they go massive ragemonster in my face because they were on the wrong street and decided to blame ME for it. (True story. Had to call the cops.)
is DD in OC suddenly treating their drivers a lot worse, and I'm getting the backlash? I used to like them so much because they apparently treated their drivers well but if that's changed, I don't want to use them for that reason either. But mainly, due to my disability I can't be wondering every time whether my food is going to turn up because if I wait too long I get sick. So I'd like to know the inside scoop on whether I should weather an apparent downturn in quality, or if there's something going on backstage that means I should just quit using them altogether.
Thanks for your help, and thanks for probably being one of the drivers who's been so great to me over the years.","Yes. Doordash is struggling miserably. Lots of drivers are extremely furiously angry, feeling like they are being treated like slaves. DD came out with a new terrible, ridiculous pay model that is slowly rolling out nationwide that is NOT transparent / clear to it's drivers. They keep their drivers in the dark with the new pay: $1 per delivery (BS) + 100% tip + effort base bullsh!t. This calculation with specific numbers and math isn't public info, it's a dirty, shady ""secret"" that benefits the company....... The old pay model use to be $5-$7 ish per delivery + 100% tip, depending on the area. Veteran drivers everywhere noticed a major pay cut. Many suspect they are STEALING A PORTION OF TIPS. The smart people have quit til the new lawsuits, and new changes hopefully happen. Everyone I know has quit cause they aren't desperate and see thru the lies & bullsh*t....... The fools driving now, let Doordash take advantage of them and don't know any better. They should quit for a few months, if only they knew the old pay model payed more fairly and HIGHER. Pay now is basically WORSE than minimum wage + adding wear n tear to your car and tons of mileage + the many other car expenses in the near future.
It's a very troubling time for DD taking advantage & exploiting their hardest workers who drive around the cities, counties in their personal cars (gas, oil, tire changes, maintenance fees come outta the drivers pocket aka losing money 😕). Software developers & management who work in the offiice on a ""phone app"" have no idea how things really are cuz they're comfortablely work in a office while their drivers do all the damn hard physical labor out there in the real world. They honestly do NOT understand it at all from their driver's workforce perspective.
Advice: Quit doordash for now. Wait for the lawsuit & backlash news over the new pay model that you hear from drivers, to be over. Hopefully new improvements & changes happen. Order from Grubhub instead, they treat & pay their drivers better. It's the #1 biggest food delivery service out there, has been around the longest since 2004.

So we got to talking and he starts asking me questions about IC, DD etc and what I thought of doing it.. Told him my honest opinion (which I’ve already said here and ain’t gonna rehash) and he said that he follows the gig jobs and thinks what DD is “horseshit” and said when he orders DD etc, always tips in cash etc and straight up asked me what my tip was, which I told him and he said good, that’s exactly what it should have been and if they’re not stealing tips he will tip in the app, but may start tipping small in app and bigger cash tips “if warranted” but he said he despises DD and hopes they burn lol..

"Got a scam call from the ""IRS"" while doing a triple DO batch from Costco.","I was frustrated trying to find the correct building in a confusing complex. Then my phone rings from what I thought may be the customer. I answer to hear a recording, saying something about the IRS, my refund, an audit, tax fraud and evasion charges, and a warrant for my arrest.
Now, I personally haven't filed taxes for a few years (I stay home with my boys), but I did complete my husband's returns and included all my contact info.
I quickly call back, and a guy with a pretty thick accent answered, and I told him it might be in reference to my husband's taxes. He said, no, it's me, then promptly asking me if I have an attorney to represent me, etc. Then he asked about my recent return, I said ""I didnt file, I haven't filed in years!"" Then he said ""you're on disability? What you do for money?"" I said ""I stay home with my kids"". Then he said ""okay"" and quickly hung up. This was a tip off that this was a scam, or a not very professional IRS agent. Anyway, I was still pretty fricking agitated, and a bit flustered while having to carry a Costco order up to the 3rd floor (no elevator), including a 24 lb bag of goddamn kitty litter, for a $2 tip. Probably my worst batch experience so far. Beware of this nonsense, because in hindsight I can't believe I even took the bate to call back, but when you hear there's a warrant out for your arrest, it's hard to stay clear headed (which is exactly what they count on).",The IRS will never call you ever.

Newb Concerns Re: Mild Physical Disability & Heavy Bulk Orders...,"Hey guys, i'm a new FSS and i start next Thursday so i've been lurking this sub for tips, advice, Shopper's general experiences with IC. So far i've found a ton of helpful information, but the one thing i've been (maybe needlessly) stressing about are the numerous horror stories i've read here about huge bulk orders of heavy beverage cases, bags of ice, pet food, etc. needing to be lugged up 8 flights of stairs and the like. i know how naive this makes me sound, but it's just one of those things i never would have thought of in a million years because i don't shop like that for my household and in all my years in retail i rarely, if ever, saw orders like that come through my lines. i understand now that's exactly why customers use IC to shop for those things, so they can have someone else do the heavy lifting for them.
i guess what i'm getting at is, how common are orders like those? i realize there are a huge number of factors in play here that make it hard to give even a rough estimate, but in YOUR experience, how many/how often have you had to deal with heavy bulk orders like that? once a day, once a week? i have chronic back problems due to a congenital deformation in my spine (not visibly noticeable yet, but i'll have a Dowager's hump you could cross the Sahara on by the time i'm 45...) and countless work-related injuries throughout my life. i do plan on getting a collapsable handcart and crates as i've seen suggested in this sub, which will no doubt help me out a great deal. the thing is, i know there are going to be days every once in a while when my back pain will make it physically impossible for me to complete an order like that and i'm going to have no choice but to decline the order. i'm just afraid of racking up like, 5 RIs in a month and getting booted right away. other than that, IC seems like a very good fit for my needs and lifestyle so i'm really hoping it's not a case of ""maybe it's just not the right job for me."" i will also have at least 1-2 other platforms like Postmates to fall back on in case i'm unable to work as many IC hours as i'd like. whew, sorry for the long winded post, guess i just have some n00b jitters to work off. but thanks for taking the time to read if you made it to the end, and any other tips or suggestions for a rookie are welcome. thanks guys!","it depends but you will get them. for me i rarely see them now a days but there was a point where it was common to see them once a week at least. for instance last week there was one day where everyone of my orders had at least one heavy item such as a 20 pound bag of rice or petfood, 10-20 pound bag of ice, or two cases of water. if your in a zone that has DO expect to see them constantly as it is common to see everyone passing up 20 cases of water from costco and they send it to you to see if you'll be the idiot who takes it when no one else wants it.
there was a point where customers would order more than one case of water and i would just grab one and tell the customer that was all they had just so i wouldn't have to do extra lifting. now a days i have a heavy dolly that folds side ways that makes it easy to haul 3 cases of water with ease so i don't mind.
so my suggestion is to either get a dolly to make things easier for you or to limit the heavy items to one per item or don't work on the platform.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/6uiibq/newb_concerns_re_mild_physical_disability_heavy/,InstacartShoppers,disability,6uiibq,2017-08-18,1,9,prettyinacasket,1,"health restrictions, suitability, advice",both,1,heavy orders,neutral,Agree,1,DISAGREEMENT,neutral,,,,1,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Instant Pay Woes,"I'm new to instant pay, and have only used it a few times. I'm a partially disabled driver, who is also a single dad of a 12 year old, so I don't get a ton of hours on the road. Knowing that my son had camp coming up next week, I instant paid myself on Friday of last week, only to see in the app the next day that the payment had failed. I called uber support on Saturday night around 7 PM to inform them, and I was told that payment would make it into my account within 72 hours, guaranteed. I proceed to do my business, expecting payment by Tuesday at 7 PM, per what I was told. Fast forward to today, and I get an email stating that my instant pay was being reprocessed, and will be in my account in 3-4 business days, which puts it out til Thursday or Friday, SIX DAYS after I pressed the cash out button. My son is supposed to leave for camp on Wednesday morning, and I need that cash to provide him with things he needs. I called uber, demanding that they tell my why this happened and what recourse I have for this inconvenience, to which I got no explanation and no recourse. This is completely unacceptable. I worked on Sunday, and was informed that my normal payment will post at the normal time, so that means my instant pay will take at most SIX days to process while normal payment will take the normal 3-4 days. All of it too late to finance my sons camp. I now have to sell belongings to pay for this, and uber gets to just waste the time and energy of someone who already has very little of both. And even though us drivers are the only reason they're in business, they'll continue to act with impunity. I am not shocked, just pissed off and needed to vent. If I could find another job that caters to my disability you bet your ass I'd do it.

"New Flex Driver, I have a few questions.","hi im a 21 year old female and im nervous. mostly because i have an anxiety disorder, but thats besides the point. do young females usually drive for flex? will i be faced with really heavy packages a lot? last question is: is it confusing or does the app keep the runs pretty self-explanatory?","Logistics dude here. Plenty of women (young, middle aged, large, or petite) doing Amazon Flex. Sometimes you’ll have the occasional heavy packages but mostly everything is under 5 pounds. As for logistics, the app is pretty much straight forward. You arrive at the warehouse location and the employees will send you to a location where you can park and see your route. All routes are random so depending on which city you live, it’s best to ask around here which one has the easier routes. The best part of Amazon Flex is you rarely interact with the customers (unless you need to call/text them). You’re mostly on your own and if you’re determine and patient, you can make some pretty good money with flex. Some quick tips: buy a safety vest. People will be less suspicious of you when you’re delivering. Have a flashlight if you’re planning on doing late evening routes. See a “beware of dog sign”?? Just safely toss the package over the gate (don’t risk getting bit by a dog). And lastly, don’t be afraid to park illegally otherwise you’re gonna take forever in you route.

Drivers not coming down my driveway?,"I have MS and I'm having a relapse right now that means I can't walk very far without my leg dragging and a lot of times I will trip over my foot. I have a pretty long, moderately steep driveway and so I set my pickup point at my front door. The last couple rides I've called wouldn't come down my driveway even after I confirmed my pickup location; I had to argue with the driver i had today and he finally relented. I feel like I shouldn't have to disclose my disability status in order to get drivers to pick me up where I indicated. Is this a new thing? It's only been recently that I've had this problem.","Recently Lyft has started taking a much higher % of the fares so drivers are doing the absolute minimum in getting to their passengers. Many times a no show fee > actually driving the passenger. With that being said you should communicate with the driver that you have mobility issues and it would make it much easier for you if you pull up to the driveway. Here is an example of a text message ""I have mobility issues and it would be much faster if you pull up to the front door. Thank you for understanding!""

Doordash cares and it shows?,"Sorry doordash but I get less pay now plus no peak pay well none in the last 2 weeks in Santa Clara county, ca. The only thing I see is the break down and how u absorb my tip. Hello Jerry,
 
In March, I wrote you to announce that we’d be conducting a series of roundtables and surveys to hear your perspectives on the Dasher pay model and how we can make DoorDash work better for you. We heard directly from thousands of Dashers and met with many of you in Chicago, Austin, and San Francisco. We learned what works, what doesn’t, and how we can improve across a range of areas that matter to all of you. 
Today I’m reporting back on what we heard and updating you not just on how we’re responding to what you shared about the pay model but also on changes we’re planning to make to improve the Dasher experience more broadly. We are committed to maintaining this ongoing dialogue with you and all members of our community, and we expect our platform will continue to evolve over the years to reflect the feedback we receive. 
Here’s what we’ve learned and what we’re doing about it.
 
What We Heard
While there are a variety of perspectives within the Dasher community on the Dasher pay model, overall we continued to hear that Dashers value transparency and consistent, fair earnings. 
 
With the current pay model, you don’t have to gamble hoping for an order with a big tip. Dashers will continue to see a guaranteed minimum (including tips) on their screen for each delivery, and you will never earn less than the guaranteed minimum if you complete the delivery, even if the customer provides little or no tip. These features of our pay model will remain intact. For more information and examples on how the Dasher Pay Model works, please see our FAQ page here.
But we also heard that there are things we can do to improve your DoorDash experience overall. In an online survey, we asked Dashers to prioritize how we can make DoorDash better. Here are the top 10 things Dashers told us, in priority order: 
￼
We’ve spent the past weeks hard at work building, testing, and planning ways to address these concerns.
\
 
The feedback we received is invaluable because our goal is to build the best platform for all of you. We want to formalize how we receive feedback from Dashers so we can stay in tune with your perspectives on an ongoing basis and make DoorDash the go-to platform. We’re therefore launching a Dasher Community Council (DCC) with representation from Dashers around the country. DCC members will help shape DoorDash’s future by testing new product features, acting as a sounding board for ideas, and voicing community concerns. If you’re interested in volunteering for a role on this Council, please see more information here.
Injury Protection for Dashers
 
Finally, I want to use this opportunity to announce something I think is especially important. Beginning Thursday, June 27, 2019, occupational accident insurance will be available for all U.S. Dashers while on a delivery. There's no cost to Dashers and no need to sign up. This insurance offers several important protections for U.S. Dashers involved in covered accidents, including medical expenses, disability payments, and survivor payments. DoorDash is already a leader in offering unprecedented freedom and flexibility to enable everyone from students to teachers to retirees to achieve their goals on their own terms. Dashers tell us that being their own boss is the #1 reason they choose to work on our platform. I believe that DoorDash can also be a leader in helping to provide more security in this new type of work. Today’s announcement is a first step in that direction. More details on coverage limits and eligibility are available here.
*         *         *
In closing, I want to thank all of the Dashers who participated in this process and provided us with valuable feedback. We know that you come to DoorDash to help achieve your goals. We want to fuel your success, and we are always striving to create the best experience for the Dashers, consumers, and merchants we serve. As CEO of DoorDash, I am committed to continually listening so we can build the best platform for all of our users. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with us.

Don't let DD fool you.,"Their recent email implies that joining their coalition will protect your scheduling flexibility. It won't because it can't - your flexibility is not being threatened. We know this because the legislation that DD objects to has been in effect since Jan. 1. 2020 and your flexibility is exactly the same.

Don't get an Uber GiftCard and don't ever expect Uber to help you,"I'm disabled and had to move on the first of September. My initial option fell through and I was forced to look for something in a pinch. I ended up using an UberXL (because I'm not an asshole) to move a few bags, tower fan, etc. Nothing huge. Either way uber will cost about $60. So a friend of mine, in the US, sends me an Uber Gift Card. I check the uber website and support to see if I can still use an American gift card in Canada and no problem. So I attached it. Popped on without an issue and showed me all the credits. Until I tried to use it the next day when I moved anyway. Apparently the currency is locked to the country its issued in, but both Uber support and the uber support website said that the currency would automatically convert. I had $65 left for the month to get groceries. Then it was all gone. I've got no food, no groceries, no nothing. I have been arguing with Uber Support for two weeks now and they refuse to do anything. Just constantly copy and pasting the same answer. This in and of itself is infuriating but what makes it worse? They actually told me, uber support themselves, that they will convert the currency and always could. So I ask them to do so and then I get paired with another clueless fucking moron who just pastes the same answer I've gotten a thousand times. They're breaking promises constantly. Their own website refuses to have any clarity. They are lying through their teeth via support (sorry sir but Uber has zero phone lines meanwhile they have like 10 but whatever). They could EASILY give me credits that add up to the currency. Not even converted with the extra few bucks. They could just give me the credits for my account and call it a day and they refuse to. Every day they paste the same answer. Every other day they say they'll help before going back to ignoring me. I am literally starving to death because Uber has some of the worst websites and support of any company around. They break promises and they do not care about you as a customer and they have already shown they don't give a fuck about riders too. I am going to die from being unable to eat and it will be Ubers fault and I hope to fuck that whoever finds my withered and good starved corpse decides to sue the goddamn fuck out of them. Heres an example of the shit they're pulling. This was with the guy who bought me the gift card. We're both trying to figure this out.

I stand to lose 80 cents to 2 dollars Per Delivery despite Fare Increase.,"On May 21st 2018 the fares in my city increased. According to the app notification I was going to ""on average Delivery fares will increase 1.2x."" [https://imgur.com/a/VRLWPes](https://imgur.com/a/VRLWPes)
I was a tad worried with this increase but I figured they would lower boost and promotions as a result. For ever .1 it is 40 cents. With the increase in fares I have seen a .2\-.4 drop in boost. I will make at least .80 cent less despite the increase in fares because we have a min fare of 4 dollars in my city. That means despite the pay increase, I will be making 10\-20 percent less money then I was before on most deliveries because most deliveries are within the 4 min fare distance (2.3ish miles). 2.3 miles \* 1.10= 2.53\*.35(uber takes 35 percent)=.89 cents. 2.53\-.89 1.64
1.64\+1.88(New pick up fee after fee)\+.88 (new drop off fee after fee.)=4.4(1.3x)= 5.72. I earned 5.72 cent on that delivery Now with the old boost and lower base rate fare.
2.3(.9)=2.07(.35)=.72 cents. 2.07\-.72=1.35
1.35\+1.56(Old pickup fee before)\+.71(old drop odd.)=3.62 Which is lower then min fare so they add a .38 cents. 3.62\+.38=4(1.6 old boost for weekdays)=6.40 cents
Even though my old fare was less because of the boosts I see a .68 cent difference in fare. On top of this Promotions have lowered as well. For me, I also looked at promotions adding to the fare of each delivery. So when it was 5 deliveries for 10 dollars (and 10 deliveries for 20), I felt like that was adding 2 dollars per delivery. They have dropped the promotions in my city. 5 for 9 and 8 for 15. These do change all of the time and have since I started but they normally were about the same and didn't effect overall earnings to much. Some times I would see a pretty good one (Low requirement for a decent payout.) Now with the slight change in when promotions pay and the amount it just adds to making less. with 5 for 9. that is only an extra 1.80 per delivery. If I take into account the .68 cents I already lost I can add another 20 cents to that. Which means for deliveries within a promotion day I am making .88 cent less. The more deliveries I take the less I will make because when promotions pay out. The highest promotions are for less deliveries and pay less. So even if I do get a chance to take 23 deliveries I will make less money. I touch on driving time later on.
While they may not have to institute a requirement to hit the min fare as often, I am still making less because the boost have dropped so much. When it comes to deliveries within the min fare, it is exactly .40 per .1 that drops on the boost. So on those really quick deliveries that are only a mile or 2 miles away, on weekdays for example, i will make 5.6 instead of 6.40. Now, on longer deliveries I will see a slight increase on deliveries but now I am dealing with delivery driving time against max possible deliveries in that 12 hours. I average about 2 deliveries per hour, on busy nights (which it has been busy lately because many drivers aren't driving because of this change) I get about 3\-4. But since short deliveries now pay much less, I will try to shoot for longer delivers which means less chance of hitting higher level promotions which means less money. So as a driver I have to figure out how to take longer delivers while still trying to fit 3\-4 in an hour to hit promotions. I can't just create time. This also limits who I can pick up from. I didn't have a problem with Mcdonald's before because I could pump out deliveries like a machine gun but now? Mcdonald's is a restaurant I have to screen because I will make less money on those deliveries I was before. but the problem is (I would estimate) 30 percent of all my deliveries are from Mcdonald's. I have to figure out how to account for that. But I can't create orders for different locations. No matter what area I am there are at least 2 to 3 Mcdonald's in the are because this is America and people need them as much they need a Starbucks ever mile. I know acceptance rates don't matter but trying to screen them when they are the same distance from me as other restaurants will be very challenging. I have to travel at least 2.7 miles or more to see almost the same earning as I was before. What is frustrating about that is last week I took 17 deliveries for a total of 46 miles (miles I was paid for.) that is on average 2.7 miles per Delivery. The fare increase and drop in everything else have completely canceled things out to the point of trying to figure out how to prevent the lose in pay while still taking longer deliveries. I couldn't imagine how people who delivery downtown feel. During lunch time, downtown can get pretty busy but many of the deliveries are pretty short distance because it is a lot of business people needing lunch and what not. It is the only advantage of working downtown. You can pump out a decent quantity within a short amount of time. But this is no longer financially beneficial. In order to maintain the same level of pay I also am more restricted from where I can pick up OR I have to work longer and delivery more in order to maintain the same level. Which I can't do because I am limited on how long I can drive. It's not even a matter of working harder. TL;DR. Increase fares. Said on average you will make 1.2x more. Lowered Boost and promotions. I make less. Have to drive longer, take longer delivers, to make the same amount of money. Can't because of drive time and can't create orders. Make less money despite a .95 ""increase"" in pay. Will edit because I am sure there are typos or could make something more clear.
Yes, run two apps, I do, I even signed up for DD as well. So grubhub/DD/Uber. I still like Uber more then Grubhub. Better everything.
I run eats because I have delivery experience and am good at the job. I know the area very well. But I have severe social anxiety and Major depressive disorder both of which are refractory (Non\-responsive to medication.) However, I did start a treatment in November 2017 that is going well enough I was able to start working some sort of job. I am unable to do normal Uber.

Low rating for not talking,"So why do passengers think it’s appropriate to rate drivers low because the driver did not initiate conversation with the passenger? One person rated me as a 2 star drive, and marked communication as the reason why. This was after he mistakenly sent me somewhere else and had to drive another 5 minutes away to him. This isn’t the first time either just the most recent. I always say “hello” or “how are you” at the start of the trip yet it still happens. I have autism which makes it harder for me to talk so it just feels like I’m getting rated low because of my disability. I’m in the dangerous ratings zone where I could potentially be kicked off as a driver yet can’t raise my rating because people either don’t rate or rate me low because I’m not talking or something. I know I’m not the best driver (almost been in one accident on a snowy road so I understand that low rating, for example) but 90%+ of my drives are perfectly fine. I even contacted Uber about this but they were no help at all. Twice they just repeated verbatim the rating policy and the third time they still said they couldn’t help me.","because someone people are not comfortable with themselves enough to handle silence for a few minutes.

Any advice on inebriation report?,My husband has been an Uber driver for a few months and just this morning found his account suspended for someone reporting inebriated driving. He's very meticulous about not driving while inebriated but he's got some behavioral quirks from a disability that will make him appear inebriated. This is the first time anyone has complained about it to Uber. I was wondering if anyone here might have some advice or experience similar situation.,"It is kinda crazy someone can so easily be deactivated. Anyways though, how is someone ""very meticulous about not driving while inebriated""? You don't have to try all that hard to drive sober. Sounds like something someone would say about an alcoholic? Don't mean to be a jerk, but that just sounded strange to me. Seems like any pax could ultimately dislike a driver and do this to anyone, couldn't they?

Disability rides,"Disabled people that I have picked up are one of the most independent and coolest people I pick up. They rarely require help and they’re nice. The caveat is most are pretty rich and have an assistant with them so I don’t have to do much. Some have real service dogs which shed like hell but surprisingly I’m not even mad at the fact that I’m forced to stopped driving for an hour to look for a working vacuum to clean it up. These people are generally my sweet spot and reaffirm that I am human and have a heart. Buttttttttt then I’m brought back into reality. This doesn’t happen a lot. Pretty rare to be honest but I just had two riders back to back who were disabled with the wheely things to help them walk. One was with National MedTran which immediately ticked me off and made me want to cancel on the spot but Lyft is bitching about me cancelling and not accepting rides so probably not best to rock the boat over this which could look bad. This woman to my joy was old and surprisingly great. She got in the car with her wheely thing by herself. I’ve had moments where I had to help people with their wheely and wheelchairs and trying to get it to fit in the car is a waste of time and pain in the ass because they should be ordering XL if we’re being honest. Anyway, she was great and easy.
On the way back to the city I have both apps running and I get a hit with Lyft again, I pull up and it’s another old person with a wheely. I’m starting to get irritated, but maybe she requires no help like the last rider. Nope, she does and I’m not that thrilled if we’re being honest with each other. He wheely wouldn’t fit in the trunk and it took a while to get it to fit in the car. She was annoying and a back seat driver telling me turn when I had a gps. The ride was only 5 minutes but guess who only made $3.75 while Lyft made $5.37? Let’s get one thing clear
I’m not mad or irritated at having to pick up disabled people. What pisses me off is Lyft partnering with a medical transport company, EXPECTING ME TO HELP RIDERS FOR FUCKING FREE!!!! Lyft and Uber have told me in writing I’m not expected nor required to do anything beyond provide a seat and a safe ride to passengers. I don’t have to help them with luggage, Uber outright said I don’t even have to make a u turn if they can cross the street. Both company’s feed riders with crap to save face but my take is this. By having more disabled people on the platform your putting me in a position to do all this work to accommodate them for free. I have no way to filter them out. I should be paid more at the very least. Recommendations.
-Medical companies should be charged more. Maybe $5-10 extra directly to drivers for the inconvenience.
-Driver should be allowed to filter disabled people’s request. This isn’t discrimination well it is but. The way I see it is, Lyft is pressuring drivers to go beyond the contractor role. If a disabled person can not enter the car without assistance from the driver and the driver isn’t legally compelled by Lyft to assist the rider, that theoretically would be a dispute between worker and company before it would be worker discriminating against disabled person. Symantec’s and chain of events. -Lyft and Uber should pay drivers the total amount paid by rider/medical company excluding taxes. This means the driver gets the service and platform/safety fees.
I understand Lyft and Uber getting heat from ADA but they need to realize drivers are not medical transporters and don’t want these rides, at least not for free while being required to put in more work.","Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Lyft partnering with hospitals and medical transport companies. Drivers are neither trained nor equipped to deal with medical situations, and we certainly aren't being paid extra to assist those who need help. In many cases, the driver is physically unable to help due to being disabled themselves.
Rideshare is a great concept, but it needs to stay where it makes sense. For example, auto dealerships give rideshare credits or low-cost rideshare rides instead of having a service shuttle. Makes sense. Bringing home grandma after having a heart transplant? Not so much.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/lyftdrivers/comments/d28w82/disability_rides/,lyftdrivers,disability,d28w82,2019-09-10,25,31,Henry1502inc,0,,,0,disabled riders,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

I can’t drive for a profession any longer,"I have been an Uber driver (and Lyft driver off and on) for over 4 years, but tonight, I’m going to have to call it. I can not do it anymore.
In the last 3 years I have driven over 25,000 miles a year and maybe more in the first year of driving for Uber. That’s not counting miles off the clock driving my wife’s car that I have no record of. I am 50 years old this year so YMMV, but I have some serious nerve damage in my right foot, ankle and lower leg from all the long days and nights of driving. I haven’t been checked out yet to see how bad the damage is but it has gotten so bad I’m going to have to throw in the towel. I only did 4 short rides today and started to loose the feeling in my lower leg down to my foot. It’s like a burning sensation that’s also numbing and tingling. I guess it’s like carpal tunnel of the leg/foot, better know as drivers foot?
The first sign of this damage started probably back about three years ago when Uber had some nice guarantees going on that made you want to drive as much as possible throughout the week/month to maximize the bonus. Fortunately for me those bonuses disappeared and so did the problem in my lower leg or I might’ve had to quit back then. But over the years with the continuous from break peddle to gas to break all day long doing it full-time, the damage has gotten so severe I am going to have to throw in the towel. If I go any longer I will do some serious serious damage if I haven’t already. I am writing this to let all drivers know what is to come doing this full time for many years but also I am looking for any information on what I can do legally. I live in California. Is there any way of getting workmen’s Comp., disability, or something that I have not thought of? Also I am an Uber select driver with a 5 series BMW and a hefty monthly payment I will not be able to afford after quitting. What do I do with this car I won’t be able to afford? I can’t trade it in or sell it since I’m upside down in it at the moment and maybe for a few more years. I am so screwed so any help would be very appreciative.
I actually enjoy driving and that’s probably why I’ve done it for so long and dealt with the pains over the years but it has gotten so bad of late that I cannot do it any longer. I blame Uber for the damages and you wouldn’t know why I say this if you haven’t driven back when I started 4 years ago. Shortly after I started they lowered the rates on us, took away incentives, and eventually added these guarantees that wanted you to drive many hours a week to maximize the bonus to just get close to what our pay used to be. I was driving like a madman day and night to maximize the bonus… And then the damage was done to my leg/foot.
To minimize any further damage over the years I have gotten really good with the cruise control, controlling the speed from the steering wheel, like a gaming controller, but that can only go so far. Short rides are the killer. There’s really no way to use the cruise control on short trips. So it must end now.
Should I get a lawyer? Does anybody have a good lawyer to talk to? What else can I do? Where do I go from here? This is crazy that I’m even typing this. I hope nobody else goes through this but it’s probably inevitable if you drive for a living and get up there in years?
Thanks for listening and for any tips/help?",">I was driving like a madman day and night to maximize the bonus… And then the damage was done to my leg/foot.

Is Flex Utility an allowed app? Is anything allowed in Android to help with swiping?,"I have muscular issues that cause problems with repetitive motion. This wasn't a problem flexing until recently, as now the rate of speed which I must tap/swipe in order to grab blocks causes me physical problems and I'm having an increasingly difficult time grabbing blocks.

I feel there is disability discrimination happening at this point, and that there should be a compromise allowed for some sort of simple script that at least allows me to tap anywhere on the screen and have it count as a swipe, like the iPhone users have.

Entry level hourly rate? And a few more newcomer questions,"I’m currently setting up my profile and I have a few questions. It’s also probably important to mention that I’m looking for jobs in illustrating or logos/catchphrases. I am self taught as far as formal education. I do not plan on attending a college for anything. I’m also not looking to strike rich on Upwork. I am actually disabled so working outside my home on a daily basis is not an option. I currently get $850~ monthly from social security, and if Upwork eventually becomes a job that allows me to not need disability anymore I’ll be happy, but I’m not expecting it. So, my questions are: 1) How much should I put as my hourly rate when I’ve only done projects for friends/family so far? 2) Is there anyone here who does work similar to what I’m interested in that can tell me how viable a job this is going to be? I don’t need a ton of money; I mostly need something to do and would like to bring in some money for my family for sanity purposes.

You are in business. It's all about the money. No one but an idiot ever spent an hour on Upwork except for money.

Customer Question - Should I report this...and how?,"We use IC a fair amount and let me first thank y’all for the work you do for those who truly appreciate your delivery services (and don’t take advantage or order ridiculous quantities from Costco). I’m also going to implement the snack basket idea I saw here the other day.
So one of the regular drivers for our area always takes a long time shopping our order, like twice as long as other shoppers and he brings his young (maybe 6-7 yo?!) daughter with him, not confirmed daughter but I assume she is. Each time it’s him I cringe as he rolls up in our street parks/brakes in the middle of it, rolls down his window and hangs his arm and head out while SHE brings the groceries to us! HE stays in the car the entire time. This has happened 3x with this guy. We have a home with a driveway and no steps to the front stoop. Where he parks in the street makes her have to traipse through our front lawn.
This happens during the day (when she should be in school) and while I believe IC is great, I don’t want to participate in his IC pimp business model if this is how he’s “working.”
Is this allowed? Can I report him? Can I request that he never delivers for us again? She’s so little and seeing her work to carry our groceries while he’s sitting in the car (and I’m paying HIM) makes me mad.

"Crazy pax refused to get out, had to call police (LA)","This story happened couple hours ago in LA and I’m still a bit shaken. To begin with, I’m a young white immigrant woman with a minor disability (visible but only if you look closely) and some anxiety issues (my safety in particular), lyft is my Friday gig. I carry pepper spray and only drive during the day to avoid drunk passengers.
I was half day through when I got this ping. It’s a young woman with her 2-3 old cute energetic son. They get inside, kid screams and refuses to get into his car seat. She informs me he’s autistic and hard to deal with, I said I have a disability as well, I get it. (2,5 minutes left to load.) He reaches to my car shift stick and I push his arms away, saying “baby it’s dangerous”. He keeps jumping on my car seats, pushing his legs on my seat, reaching car panel, pulling out napkins etc. She doesn’t try to stop him. I’m still patient, hoping eventually she’s gonna put him in his seat and we’ll go. When 5 minutes passed, I said “I’m so sorry, unfortunately I have to cancel, there are other passengers waiting for me”. And there she goes nuts. I tried to distance my thoughts but some phrases I heard:
You discriminate against disabled child, you’re not f-Ing disabled yourself, you’re lying, you only care about money and your precious car. You’re white and racist piece of s***. You are afraid of a 2 year black child. At this point I turned off my car, got ouside and called police because she was still yelling in my car and refused to get out. Police arrived and she finally got out telling me “go get your money btch”. Her child went running into traffic and police officers had to catch him. She didn’t have control over her child. Police told me to go and they were talking to her about child engagement. “Mam, you put Uber and a phone conversation before your child safety??” -last officer’s words I heard before leaving.
Got in the car and found spilled Arizona tea and some shoe prints. Cried my eyes out and I don’t know if I’ll ever drive lyft again. My mental state is fragile. I’ve been accused of faking disability, discriminating against disabled child and being racing. I know I’m not but it feels like she dumped a bucket of shit on my head. I probably won’t get much reimbursement for a spilled tea, I just hope she gets blocked and gets help with her behavior issues.

Confused on what I did wrong!,"On mobile don't be too upset! So I'm a rider and I'll be honest sometimes I have a bad mood so I just stay quiet and not speak at all to the driver, just say pleasantries and verify I'm the rider they are suppose to pick up. Anyway today was the first time I was actually scared of the driver. I was more afraid because I had my legally blind mother that uses a walker and is on dialysis with me. I made her miss the disability bus that usually picks her up and take her to dialysis. So I got an Uber and most of the time we are late meeting the driver but today we was outside before the car pulled up! So I'll try to not leave anything out because I honestly want to know what I did that upset this driver! So I used to drivers getting out and helping me/picking the Walker in their trunk but today I wasn't upset about this driver for not doing that, about half way in the ride I forgot that he didn't do it so I believe I didn't show my displeasure of the lack of help. I love drivers that don't talk, don't ignore any that does but I am very happy when the driver just pits the radio on! This driver didn't talk so I was happy and that also helped in me for getting about the driver not helping. I usually don't care about the music being played but my mother is old, and set in her way so cursing is not allowed at all and I'm 32 years old so yeah I was very uncomfortable with the driver choice of music.(uncensored rap music) I love all genres but my mom is not open minded about a lot of cursing and the songs had a lot! I know should have just said something but you never how drivers feel about some random stranger telling them what to do in their car! Lastly, we finally get to the dialysis center and this is the part that made me feel very uncomfortable. The stops the car gets out and about to take out the walker, which I was a bit shocked about. I had to quickly tell him could be please pull up a bit more because the spot he stopped at was in the grass and again this stop was at the dialysis my mother go too. She can't see to lift her foot on the sidewalk so she needs to use the wheelchair part of the sidewalk.
This seem to me what I guess the boiling point for this driver. He yelled I have to wait for this guy to moved and jump back in the car. He only had to wait about 5-10 seconds. The other car was already pulling out when he yelled that. That's when I felt super scared because this driver blew up because we needed to use the wheelchair part of the sidewalk! So I immediately got out of the car closed the door hurry and got my mom out which she was angry at me for rushing her. (yes she is blind and hard at hearing!)
When the ride started I added another stop back to our home, a whole trip but after that blow up I removed the stop and just quickly pushed my mom in to the center just encase. So in the end I don't know what I did wrong! What was it? Why the anger? Was it because it's Monday or it was very early in the morning? Was is because we are black or female? I don't know! Most of the time when I have a bad interaction with someone I get over it quickly or I figure out that I may have caused the problem but this I have zero idea what went wrong and I don't know what I did. So hopefully someone here who is a driver or rider can tell me so if I ever get this driver again this incident won't happen again. Thanks so much for taking this seriously and giving honestly answers.",I’m a driver and I would never treat people like this.

Collection of bizarre wtf incidents that happened to me as an Uber driver in Minneapolis.,"So Holierthanthee woman thought I'm likely not even an Unexpected driver. So I will share with you guys my past incidents, some I have on dashcam and most are not on YouTube and backed up to Cloud. But here goes. These are in order going from recent and backwards. I'll make them short so I don't tire your eyes with reading as I know time as valuable for you. Been a driver since 2015 with Lyft and Uber.
> Picked up a young working Engineer professional from his luxury condo and when we got to his girls house he said ""Ozzy can I ask you a question,?"", And I was like it doesn't sound right when you have to ask permission to ask question. Then he said ""Is it ok if I sucked your dick?"". I told him your girl is waiting for me, sorry am not gay.
------------------------------
>Picked up 2 older women from that same condo of that guy who asked me if he can suck my dick, and they never said anything anything when they got in car (100%) of my pax always at least greet or say hi, and I say Welcome with happy smile. I arrive at their destination and one of them starts saying with a cold attitude ""I need you to drop me off right in front of door, align me with door"". She wasn't handicap or very old, so I was surprised and did so anyways. And materials see a 1 star. I think they have been through problems with other drivers so they are hostile to new drivers.
-----------------------------------
>I've done thousand airport rides with past cars and pax man gets in car from left side and moves over to very far right and he never shut door, I was like wtf? I asked him will you close door? Maybe he was thinking this is some Limo service where we open and shut doors. Door was wide open and he finally reached over to shit it.
----------------------------
> Picked up Pax man from Mystic Lake Casino without surge and he told me he just lost $3,000 at Casino and that he also waited 40 mins for Uber surge to go away. His distance was a $60 distance had it been surge and $27 without surge. I told him the area is very hard to find a driver since it is one. Reservation far away, so I was under the impression he would actually be greatful for a ride and allow surge like there is no tomorrow. But apparently it is ok to lose $3k to a Casino, but not to an Uber.
------------------------------------------------------
>This one comes with a YouTube dash cam. https://youtu.be/XFw9EeWOurg
I picked up some newlyweds from Uptown Minneapolis, and they had another guy with me. Both guys were huge and can kick my ass if they wanted to, but on with the story Woman grabs my charger from my own phone, disconnects it and then thinks she can plug my own android charger into her own phone. I told her (without yelling or raising my voice that she just grabbed my own charger and that she should ask first) in YouTube video you can hear on dashcam I am playing nice music from my phone and am mumbling music and other stuff cuz it is end of my shift and I'm tired, but the woman started getting defensive as if I offended her when in fact she offended me and she just would not stop talking to me even though I let go of the matter, I was trying to be patient and making sure my own end of shift tiredness wasn't affecting my judgement with this incident that is unfolding for this last ride that took me on very good surge to near my mom's house. The woman just would not give up so I told her man who is sitting in back, can you please tell your woman to stop talking to me as this isn't her ride and we are do are talking? And then he initially sided with me and he even said ""that bitch show shut up"" he called his own newly wed wife a bitch. I think alcohol was making her over confident and she wasn't aware I as an Uber can throw them all out in a Jiffy on the cold winter freeway, but I am not the type to strand fellow citizens. The her man sided with her and told me ""I'm gonna report you to Uber"", at which point I kicked them out and other taller guy with them was begging me to take him when he came to my window, I said sorry man some bad incident occured here so I can't, just crash with them as they brought you along. ------------------------------------------------
> Picked up a man around late 40s or 50s who was dressed nice and looked like your average father of your average American family. He told me he just got kicked out of Uptown because they thought he didn't fit in, and then when we got on freeway toward nearby city where he was going he asked me ""You're not sending the drug dealers to associate me are you?"". I told him do you want me to kick you out for telling me that or are you having some sort of medical issue or do you need soda to get blood sugar back or something? He started apologizing so I just dropped him off to his destination.","Holy fuck - you've gone off the deep end again haven't you ? :(

I block at least 30+ requesters a day and there never seems to be a stop to the slave wage. I like many others on here do this full time for reasons outside of our control. I am mentally disabled (fear of crowds and extreme anxiety in public) and I was turned down for SSI twice, So I have to somehow get money for my bills and food and thats why I grind the ever living shit out of mturk. I have no choice, I dont drive a car due to my mental issues and I live in an area where I cannot walk to a job if I somehow got one. So Mturk really is my last option or else id have to move out of my house on our family inherited land, I live in an area where 60% of the residents live under the poverty rate. So when you post a HIT up that pays $5 or under an hour, just think about whos on the other side doing that HIT for you, We are desperate for good paying HIT's. most of us here dont even have a choice, we have to do mturk. Do you see where I am coming from. Take for example there is a batch that drops every other day on here ive been trying to find ways to automate clicks and copy/paste, scrolls within it through scripting. Its pretty pathetic that us turkers have to find a way to cut corners and cheat through a HIT to make it worth it because your HIT is so poorly formatted or just wastes our time. And these are HIT's that are qualed only for US workers, so they arent looking for 3rd world countries who would gladly do them for pennies. When you force a worker to cut corners or cheat to get decent pay on your HIT's your just hurting your data accuracy in the long run, But seeing how you still post the same $5 an hour batch HITs on a nearly daily basis it seems you could care less about your data quality. I explained this before but it seems requesters dont care about data accuracy, It seems mturk to them is just getting the work done in any way possible regardless if its accurate. Ok suit yourself , Ill continue to use my custom made scripts that automates most of the HIT and at any moment I could slip up and submit a HIT with poor accuracy just because I seen that the hourly wage was starting to drop under $7 an hour. We workers have scripts that can block you and also we all have a script that shows the current hourly wage of the HIT as we continue to work on it. If I see that hourly wage drop under $7 (thats my bare minimum ill work for) an hour its an instant return and block most of the time, because requesters who post one underpaid HIT are 99% likely to not increase the pay next time. So theres no reason to let that requester have a chance at getting another one of their HIT's in my queue. So sorry for the rant, I felt like getting this off my chest, It seems Mturk is really going down hill lately and there seems to be no change to the pay no matter how much the community voices itself, I encourage the rest of the community raise your voice, lets do something about these underpaid HIT's that flood the platform. This is getting to the point to where Mturk is not reliable for money unless you have great closed quals or masters.","> Ok suit yourself , Ill continue to use my custom made scripts that automates most of the HIT and at any moment I could slip up and submit a HIT with poor accuracy just because I seen that the hourly wage was starting to drop under $7 an hour. Annnnnddd this is why many requesters choose to leave the platform or drop pay tremendously. If you don't like a HIT/batch, then don't do it. It's that simple. Purposely manipulating their data out of spite is just as cheap as those who scam workers. I remember talking to a requester over email and even though the pay was fantastic, they mentioned majority of the workers used bots/scripts to complete the task or not do it properly which ruined their data that they paid for. Have not seen them since. Just because a requester pays well doesn't mean people won't cheat the system.

My Experience Driving for Postmates as an Autistic Adult,"There’s a short story named Manna that you may have read. It was published by Marshall Brain on his own website more than a decade ago. Since then it’s inspired a great many tech writers who later became influential in the national discussion about technological unemployment, and the possibility of a basic income.
In Manna, a fast food chain automates management rather than low level labor by having a simple AI issue instructions to the employees via bluetooth headphones. The headphones are tracked such that the AI can keep tabs on where the employees are, how quickly they complete tasks, if they take unauthorized breaks and so on.
Take a little bit too long to perform tasks compared to the average? You’re fired. Good luck getting work anywhere else, as every other employer uses the same software, and they all share performance data. This sounds like an episode of Black Mirror. But then, we’re now living in an episode of Black Mirror. Amazon makes use of a system extraordinarily similar to Manna (the titular management AI from the story) to scrutinize every little action of their few remaining warehouse employees. It’s an increasingly popular method of pressuring already overworked and underpaid employees to push themselves a little bit further. To squeeze perhaps another drop or two of blood from a stone which has already been exsanguinated. It reduces the human employee to what is essentially a meat robot, necessary only for the physical coordination, real time optical recognition and other capabilities humans are still better at than robots. They just have some sort of gadget on them which tells them what to do.
This is also the sort of job Postmates is. And Uber, Lyft, Door Dash, Grubhub, etcetera. Jobs only in the barest sense of the term as these companies do not offer any of the benefits or safeguards that a traditional employer does. You take all the risk, they take all but a meager slice of the reward.
When you drive for Postmates, you enter into their service as what, from their perspective, is an imperfect self-driving car. You, the warm, soft, feeling human, are just the part that does the driving. When driverless cars become available, their business model will change.
A restaurant employee will place the food in the trunk and lock it. The car will drive to the address you gave it when you ordered. You’ll be texted that your food has arrived and when you acknowledge this in the app, the trunk will unlock. Once you indicate you’ve removed your food and the trunk is closed and locked again, the car drives off.
This places everybody who drives for Postmates and similar services in an extremely precarious position, right where they want us. We do risky, tedious work for peanuts and face imminent replacement, on top of being essentially disposable navigational units with none of the rights or protections that employees normally have. Some of these protections include accommodations for persons with disabilities required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Under this act, all employers must make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons who, for one reason or another, are unable to perform as efficiently as a healthy person.
Do you think a company which already has evaded every standard requirement for employee protections will make any accommodation whatsoever? When they hold all of the cards, and can instantly replace you with the press of a button?
That’s a rich joke. You either perform at the same level as everybody else or you get replaced. No reason given, because of course if they told you why, it could be legally actionable. Just a notification that your rating has remained below 4.7 for too long followed by a summary dismissal. It’s a world in which everybody runs on treadmills, positioned at the edge of a chasm. If you cannot keep up the pace, over the edge with you. There’s always someone fitter waiting to take your place and keep the machine running. There’s little room in this world for anybody whose talent isn’t running. Or lifting, or writing, or whatever other use they might have for you. You’d better excel at it or you’re homeless by next month, only ever a disposable component that is thrown away the minute it begins to wear out. About 8 out of 10 American workers now live paycheck to paycheck. This, too, is exactly where they want us. If we have any extra money to squirrel away in savings, it means they’re not extracting as much surplus value from us as they could be. It should not surprise you then, that this experience is even more severe for people with mental conditions of one sort or another. Even those which do not necessarily interfere much with higher brain function, like asperger’s syndrome (now “high functioning autism”.)
85% of adults with high functioning autism are unemployed. Not because they cannot work, but because employers identify these applicants by outwardly discernible symptoms during the interview stage and turn them away. Persons on the autism spectrum come with a host of small quirks which, like irregularities in a gear or other mechanical component, cause unwanted friction.provide charity jobs for autistic people. No CEO does. It’s like a perverse game of hot potato, or like being the nerdy kid in gym class when they’re picking teams. “I don’t want him, you take him!” “No, YOU take him!”
Not my problem, they think. Nothing is their problem. Not the health or safety of their drivers. Not the reliability of the software they have us use. Not extenuating circumstances outside of the control of the driver, not even paying their fair share of taxes. What do I want? Do I want free money? No, or I’d be on disability, which is remarkably hard to get when you’re an able bodied white male with a disability that is not outwardly visible. Do I want the government to pay employers to tolerate me? Not especially, but there exists such a program. Vocational rehabilitation is intended to identify your skills and set you up with a job that leverages them, subsidizing some of the cost of employing you in exchange for patience from the employer. But being a government appendage it operates extraordinarily slowly and the type of jobs they pair you with make you wonder if living in your car is really that bad.
Do I want to be impossible to fire even if my performance is mediocre? Like a union job, or a tenured teaching position? No. What I want is wider awareness of the difficulties that autistic adults have which NTs do not. I want actual, meaningful accommodation which acknowledges that my employer cannot reasonably expect the same performance from me as an NT. I want an employer that doesn’t search for ways around that, so they can feign compliance with the ADA while not actually compromising. I want a dignified existence. I don’t want to live in my car. I want enough money to feed my cat, then myself. I want to find someone I love who loves me back, which is difficult to achieve if you don’t have a house, car and reliable income. I am happy to work for all of this if somebody will let me. That’s part and parcel of the social contract. Even Marx said that he who does not work will not eat. Misery is supposed to love company, but I derive no comfort from the knowledge that there are countless other people in the same sinking boat. It’s not a problem unique to the autistic either, just felt more severely. The more of us are replaced by apps, kiosks, driverless cars and factory robots, the more people will be taking whatever work they can get to keep the lights on. Even recently when I was waiting for food to be prepared at the pickup location, I saw two or three other people with their Door Dash, Postmates or Grubhub bags. There weren’t that many when I started. Next month, I’d wager there will be more. Like Wal Mart jobs, because the pay is insufficient, many who drive for Postmates, Uber, etc. are on benefits of one sort or another. The state basically subsidizes these companies by paying them the remainder of a livable wage. These companies present themselves as a trendy and innovative way to make a little extra money in your free time. In reality they’re increasingly relied upon by underemployed young people and the elderly, whose social security has been raided by the same ownership class that tries to convince us it’s fashionable to eat bugs, or live in fancy trailers called tiny homes on the grounds that it’s environmentally conscious. In the past, populations of serfs lived in huts on their lord’s land, toiling in the fields and giving most of it to the lord for the privilege of using that land. The future looks to be populations of underemployed, gig economy drivers living in their cars, “tiny homes” or vans in the parking lot of the local Wal Mart, making only exactly what they need to survive. If that’s all NTs can manage by then, probably the only autistic people left will be engineers who design the drones which prevent any attempts to disrupt this arrangement. As someone raised on a steady diet of Syd Mead and Isaac Asimov, I remember reading starry eyed predictions of a future wherein we’d be liberated by robotic workers to pursue our dreams. No longer working simply to live, we could focus on bettering ourselves or just enjoying being alive. I still bitterly recall illustrations of beautiful futuristic cities where everybody looks happy and healthy. “Closer than you think!” the caption read. Nobody looks homeless or hungry. Nobody has to justify their existence by keeping their rating above 94%, and nobody is flipping their shit at a scared stranger over late tendies.",Damn you wrote a book.

california law could cause big trouble doordash and other independent contractor work,"[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill\_id=201920200AB5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB5) [https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/ab-5-freelancers-bill/](https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/ab-5-freelancers-bill/) the measure would redefine what it means to be an employee in California, extending labor protections and benefits like health care, overtime, and minimum wage to many workers formerly labeled as independent contractors. If passed, the bill would make “ABC” the standard for determining employment status in California. The three-part gauge mandates that a worker can only be considered a contractor if they are:
1. Free from the “control and direction” of the company they’re working for.
2. Performing work that is “outside the course” of the company’s usual business.
3. And have their own independently established trade, occupation, or business.
This is [far stricter](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/20/18272918/conde-nast-epicurious-employee-freelancer-contractor) then the current federal determinations for employment status, and would apply to a wide variety of industries. A sizable list of occupations—including doctors, architects, engineers, and independent hair stylists—would be excluded.
The point, she says, is to protect workers from exploitation and to classify them as real employees with the power to unionize, not to stifle their independence. “We don’t want to deny somebody the opportunity to, say, submit a story to *The New York Times*,” she says. “So we are looking at freelancers and working with some of the associations and unions to come up with a definition for what a ‘real’ freelancer is.” AMENDED  IN  ASSEMBLY MAY 24, 2019 AMENDED  IN  ASSEMBLY MAY 01, 2019 AMENDED  IN  ASSEMBLY MARCH 26, 2019 CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE— 2019–2020 REGULAR SESSION **ASSEMBLY BILLNo. 5** **Introduced by Assembly Member Gonzalez** **December 03, 2018** **An act to add Section 2750.3 to the Labor Code, relating to employment, and making an appropriation therefor.** ## LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST",so tired of shitheads making 'laws',3,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/bzhisx/california_law_could_cause_big_trouble_doordash/,doordash,disability,bzhisx,2019-06-11,2,8,jcwainc,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"California bill curbing use of contractors would not exempt Uber, Lyft, other tech firms","[https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-uber-lyft-employee-contractor-bill-20190326-story.html?fbclid=IwAR1Cd3ENs\_jklxOKhumM4uxNijFbWQoRQzZ8sqhJ0wud4cstP\_zMwAXaqFQ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-uber-lyft-employee-contractor-bill-20190326-story.html?fbclid=IwAR1Cd3ENs_jklxOKhumM4uxNijFbWQoRQzZ8sqhJ0wud4cstP_zMwAXaqFQ) California is moving to codify a sweeping court decision curbing employers’ use of independent contractors, and the new law is unlikely to exempt Uber, Lyft and other app-based technology companies.
The two ride-hailing giants are on the verge of going public with[ initial stock offerings ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lyft-ipo-uber-20190301-story.html)valued at tens of billions of dollars. Both companies are losing money, and converting their California drivers, currently classified as contractors, to employees would cut into their potential profits.
“Am I concerned about the stock price of Uber and Lyft?” said Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), author of Assembly Bill 5, who planned to release the legislation’s new language Wednesday.
“No. It doesn’t keep me up at night.”
The bill offers exceptions for a small group of occupations and may include more as it moves through the Legislature. But employers offering services through digital platforms won’t be among them, Gonzalez added. “It’s not going to happen.”
Classifying workers as employees requires companies to pay for overtime, Social Security and Medicare taxes, workers’ compensation, unemployment and disability insurance, and benefits such as family leave and sick pay. That can add about 30% to labor costs.
[Are you an employee or a contractor? Carpenters, strippers and dog walkers now face that question »](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dynamex-contractors-20190223-story.html)
The California Supreme Court last April set [a strict new test ](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-independent-contract-20180430-story.html)for classifying workers as contractors. The ruling was in favor of drivers for Dynamex Operations West, a package delivery company, who disputed the company’s move to reclassify them as contractors and force them to use their own vehicles — a similar model to that of app-based ride-hailing companies.
Uber, Lyft, Amazon, Grubhub, Postmates and other gig economy behemoths are facing[lawsuits](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-uber-drivers-settlement-20190312-story.html) across the country brought by thousands of workers who say they are misclassified as contractors. They are not alone: A broad swath of sectors including [trucking, construction, janitorial services,](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/misclassification-in-california-a-snapshot-of-the-janitorial-services-construction-and-trucking-industries/) home care, newspapers and even strip clubs have grappled with similar complaints.
“Lyft drivers are independent contractors who decide when, where, and for how long they wish to drive,” Loni Mahanta, Lyft’s vice president of future of work, wrote in an email. “We are engaging with policy makers, labor, drivers, worker advocates, and others to actively explore options to allow drivers to maintain this flexibility while also addressing the lack of benefits for independent contractors.""
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill.
The Gonzalez legislation may be amended over the next few months, but as currently written, it grants just four exemptions to the court’s test for designating workers as contractors. Those are for doctors, insurance agents, financial advisors and “direct sellers” who offer products to consumers under the aegis of such companies as Mary Kay, the cosmetics firm, or Herbalife, the supplements giant.
Those occupations are already regulated by other statutes but adding them to the bill makes their exemption more explicit.
The bill’s new language is basically “a declaration of existing law,” Gonzalez said. But she added, “We know we have more work to do. We will have another round of amendments for additional folks such as Realtors and hairdressers.”
“We don’t want to stop true independent contractors from having their own little businesses. But we don’t want to continue this farce of large businesses declaring their people are independent contractors. These workers miss out on all benefits of being an employee.”
The California Chamber of Commerce, which last year [urged the Legislature to “suspend or postpone the application of the Dynamex decision](https://www.electran.org/wp-content/uploads/Dynamex-Coalition-Letter.pdf),” praised the exceptions in the current bill. But the group said in an email that exemptions should also be extended to “all individuals who enjoy, prefer, and benefit from the flexibility and security of performing work as independent contractors.”
Gonzalez said she had met with dozens of companies, some of which sought exceptions, as well as individual workers who want to make sure they are not exempted.
Echoing an argument made by a unanimous Supreme Court, she said, “California continues to lose millions — possibly billions — of dollars. [Studies](https://crr.bc.edu/working-papers/failure-to-contribute-an-estimate-of-the-consequences-of-non-and-underpayment-of-self-employment-taxes-by-independent-contractors-and-on-demand-workers-on-social-security/) show many independent contractors don’t actually pay their[ taxes](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-money-talk-independent-contractor-tax-consequences-20190127-story.html).”
Moreover, she added, the cost of treating low-income injured or sick contractors often falls on the state, while workers who are paid below minimum wage and denied overtime often end up on food stamps.
[Independent contractors are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-nlrb-independent-contractors-20190125-story.html), which protects workers who organize unions — a fact that partly accounts for the strong support for the Dynamex decision in labor circles. The California Labor Federation is sponsoring Gonzalez’s legislation and has jointly drafted its language. It is reluctant to carve out significant exemptions to the bill.
“We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring millions of workers out of exploitative working conditions and rebuild the middle class,” said labor federation legislative director Caitlin Vega.
“AB 5 will protect that landmark decision,” she added. “Workers will gain higher wages, greater workplace protection and a safety net in hard times.”
As for the app-based technology companies, she said, “we have had nonstop meetings with every industry and company which has asked. The bar to get exempted is properly high. How are they treating their workers? It is a myth that independent contractors necessarily have more flexibility than employees. Our employment laws allow flexibility.”
Last year, Assemblyman Evan Low (D-San Jose) introduced [Assembly Bill 2765](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2765) to establish a new category of worker called “marketplace contractor,” which would have allowed app-based companies to avoid classifying workers as employees. [Similar legislation in other states has been sponsored by Handy,](https://qz.com/work/1240997/handy-is-trying-to-change-labor-law-in-eight-states/) a digital platform for household services, and other gig companies and has been adopted in Kentucky, Florida, Utah, Iowa, Tennessee and Indiana.
In California, after stringent opposition from a swath of unions, the bill died.
“The California Legislature has a Democratic supermajority,” Vega said. “They believe in worker protections.”",Good.

California Based- LA Full-Service Instacart Shoppers-- Need Advice!,"Hey there!
Your insight would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance!
I have been a Full-Service Instacart Shopper for the past 3 months. This income has been my main source of income. I have worked 7 days a week, over 50+ hours during this time.
With confirmed cases in LA (my area) and the Governor ""shelter at home in place until further notice"" can I apply for CA Unemployment Benefits as I am an independent contractor with Instacart? The stimulus package that just passed includes Independent Contractors.
First time ever doing this Independent Contractor type work. I have not worked since the Pandemic was declared and the Governor issued the ""Stay At Home"" Order as confirmed cases have been increasing. I have roommates that are elderly and another two are immunocompromised. I cannot be with the public in retail stores and subject myself to coming into contact or spreading contact the virus with my roommates. Instacart as you know is only offering support for those that GET SICK. That is great. They should! For all the money, I have made Instacart these past few months, I feel some financial support is warranted to all shoppers part-time or full-service. We are all on the same team supporting Instacart business/profits/revenue. **WHEN YOUR WORK FORCE IS PRIMARY FULL-SERVICE SHOPPERS/INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS YOU OWE IT TO YOUR TEAM TO SUPPORT THEM WITH ASSISTANCE.**

We both did a double take pointedly asked the listed name on our end (which obviously didn't belong to either of us in either case). Some laughs and a short explanation later I'm walking away with a $5 cash tip on a minimum.",I do PM and Doordash with my husband on the weekends when he’s not working his full time job.

Bathing,"Had a pax this morning that smelled terrible. Second time this has happened. Needs bath and fresh underwear. I think I probably live in a fairly clean population here.

As far as I can tell, the customers had ordered ice cream from McDonald’s, as well as some other food. Not surprisingly the ice cream machine from McDonald’s was out of order. The dasher let the customers know that McDonald’s was unable to complete the full order, and that they would be receiving a refund for their ice cream FROM Doordash itself. The customers complain and RECORD the whole ordeal, and basically force the Dasher to pay the refund out of his own pocket!!!

Am I In The Wrong? Or Was My Driver a Jackass?,"so I always try to be as so I always try to be as Firstly, let me preface this by saying I use UBER/LYFT as my primary mode of transportation. I have a medical disability that prevents me from driving and as a responsible citizen I don't put myself behind the wheel. Too many different medications on board at this point to justify safely being behind the wheel.
So, as a result, I use Uber & Lyft. I really appreciate the service and hard work that goes into every ride. I'm always as [pleasant as possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/6o4lvo/believe_it_or_not_some_riders_appreciate_you_guys/). Today I had one of those $5 rides that I needed. I've been in a lot more pain than usual so I didn't want to walk the 15 minutes to the store when I could take an Uber, spend 5-7 min getting a precook rotrissarie chicken and heading back home.
So I put in the stops like this:
1. My pick up location/home
2. The Store
3. My original location/home
Just yesterday, I had to go 7 minutes away to pick up medication before returning home. There was a line at the pharmacy and I explained that over text to my driver, apologized like 10 times and left him a $5 tip for the trouble/waiting. There were no issues with that driver waiting. So tonight as we pull up to the store I tell him I'll be no more than 7 minutes and he tells me Lyft will cancel the ride automatically if I stay longer than 5 minutes. I explain I put in the 2nd stop back home and it has never done that to me before. So as I get out of the store exactly 6 minutes and 15 seconds later (I set a time to keep track) I can see a very dissappointed look on my drivers face. I get in and just say, ""Okay the original location should be in the app, lets go back there, thanks for waiting."" He then starts in about how Lyft automatically canceled the ride and I told him that was impossible because the ride had two stops an no more than 6min 15seconds was spent at the 1st stop. He insists anyway. So I just figure to myself - not outloud or anything thing that I wont tip this guy this time and that's when he starts bitching at me, ""Well now because you're here I have to take you home for free and you're going to give me a bad rating anyway, because you don't pay attention to the app and am a dumb rider."" He called me a dumb rider... I stopped him, told him I didn't feel safe in his car, unbuckled my seatbelt at the red light exited safely and callled for another ride because I HAVE to get home somehow, but before I report all this to lyft am I missing anything or did I do things correctly? I was quite shocked by how hostile this driver was. We all have our good and bad days, today was pretty rough for me, I just don't get it.... Dunno, wanted insight before I ruin someone's reputation completely on Lyft.... thoughts?","*Technically* you were correct, using multiple stops for the store trips are not against TOS. However, you were quite wrong at the same time:
1. Lyft *suggests* keeping your stops to 5 minutes max. Make your driver wait any longer, and in most cases he'll end the ride. Why's that? Well…
2. Drivers are paid few cents per minute of waiting. **Cents**. Your driver would've earned *much* more money by searching for lost quarters under parking meters. 3. Your best options are either ordering separate rides to and from the store, or tipping your ""roundtrip"" driver *in cash* at the first stop, **in advance.**
PS: Multiple stop feature was **not** intended for shopping. Using it like you did means abusing the drivers.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/8lpij5/am_i_in_the_wrong_or_was_my_driver_a_jackass/,Lyft,disability,8lpij5,2018-05-23,2,47,thefaith1029,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Definitely a normal grocery store compared to Aldi but still a budget store. And so I ask this because I don't understand. To me, having groceries delivered would be a luxury and it would only make sense if I was wealthier than I am, or if I had a disability or other circumstance that prevented me from driving. And the orders I get are relatively small too. Not much more than 20 items tops, grocery bill usually comes out to somewhere between 40 and 80 dollars. I don't know if I'm making sense here but I just find the clientele to be odd. Many of my deliveries are to trendy downtown lofts...but they send me to a budget grocery store 20 minutes away instead of a normal priced one closer to their apartment. I literally delivered to a guy today who lives in a high rise apartment above a new very nice grocery store downtown. He could literally take the elevator down to inside of the store. Yet he uses Instacart to order groceries from a store 20 minutes away. Was actually my best order of the day, decent tip. It just boggles my mind. Like, is he ordering from a grocery store 20 minutes away to save money over getting groceries from the pricey store downstairs? Is he really saving that much when after delivery fee and tip he probably pays a good $10-$15 more than he would if he shopped himself?
I know it's probably fruitless to think about this...but if you have money to spend, why not order delivery from nicer grocery stores? And if you don't have money to spend then why are you ordering groceries?",I’ve saw so many families that live beyond their means since starting this job. You would be surprised what people sacrifice so their kids can go to a good school or live in a nice house and neighborhood. Lots of people that seem and look rich are eating hot dogs and chili every night in order to keep that nice house. When I was young one of my friends who I thought was super rich would always come over to my house and be starving so I would get him some food. Mind you my family was not rich at all with 4 kids to feed and only 1 parent worked. But this kid lived in the nicest houses and drive nicest cars and all that. Turns out when I get older this was all a facade by his parents in order to try and improve the kids social standing and all that. Soon as that kid graduated his parents lost everything and got divorced. Things are rarely as they seem.,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/bizfrd/aldi_and_budget_stores/,InstacartShoppers,disability,bizfrd,2019-04-30,0,25,poopenbocken,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Advice wanted from Shoppers,"Hi there! I wanted a quick advice on my experience today, I have yet to rate below 5 stars, and I really don't want to but I feel torn in this situation. My shopper marked all my items shopped, en-route to me, she let me know that 2 of the items were out of stock, I messaged back that, that was fine, the replacements I chose will suffice, I didn't get a reply back, and saw that she was already en route. At delivery it was a kid (young boy) who delivered all my groceries (could not have been have been older than 13), that kind of worried me, because he was so young, I'm guessing his mom (my shopper) waited in the car. The reason I'm hesitating about giving less than 5 stars is because: 1) What if she has a disability and her son assists her? 2) Maybe she had other children in the car she didn't want to leave alone? 3) If she is still new at this, perhaps I can give her 5 stars but give her a heads up if I'm matched with her again?",Shoppers don’t get to have kids do the delivery. If you can’t do it yourself don’t do it at all. You need to call customer support and explain the entire thing fully. This is a bad shopper She’s trying to elicit a big cash tip out of you by sending her kid to your door.

Acessibility,"On more than one occasion I have taken a lyft ride and it has been a big pickup truck. I am physically li ited. I walk just fine but have an invisible disability at the moment. Back story: I caught pneumonia and influenza which turned into sepsis. I am 31 now. I spent all of 2018 in the hospital; life support for the first 2 months, then ICU, Reg hospital then physicial therapy rehab. I continued physical therapy at home, and I am walking and physically able to get around after learning to walk again.
Muscles deteriorates and you have to gain that all back. That takes time. I feel super embarrassed when it takes me forever to get into a lyft when its a big pickup truck or..
Why is any raised car allowable?
My question is.. How can you specify disabilities or whathave you on your lyft profile?
I see the option for pronouns but no spot for comments etc.
All of the drivers have been accepting and understanding when I explain I don't quite have that strength back yet. Alas, it's not their job to physically assist me. I never rate drivers less for their vehicle due to my limitations. Please advise.","I'm not sure if there is much you can do other than possibly cancel within the first two minutes if you see that the driver has a pickup truck, and re-request the ride until you get someone with a sedan or SUV.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyft/comments/cry794/acessibility/,Lyft,disability,cry794,2019-08-18,6,8,fluid_emotions,0,,,0,customer POV,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Does Door dash really take ratings serious?,"So, I've been doing DD for two days and even though I'm liking the money and the location (I walk to my car and stat delivering as soon as I get out of my apartment complex), I've already had an issue with the app screwing up two hours worth of orders, I have a one start rating for no reason (I've only done eight deliveries and they were all on time), and I hate the bombardment of orders while you're in the middle of an order. Anyway, I'm rather pissed about this rating thing, iunno why it could be low. I don't look into their bags and physically check, maybe missing items? I go through the items with the merchant. Cold food? The bag suck for temp control and I'm in Chicago where its 30 degees, so that doesn't help. Maybe I look high or smell like weed? I have to smoke for my disorder so I can't help anything there. Do you guys have any tips for getting good ratings, like from personal experience? Also, does anyone know of any containers that hold heat better than that bag? Does anyone have bad ratings and has anyone actually gotten deactivated?
If you already couldn't tell, I kind of have to use this job for everything its worth so yeah, I need it. My disability makes it the only thing I can do reasonably well without triggering my symptoms.","I sure hope so. I'm delivering in the Chi burbs and people are weird sometimes.

"Hold up. Of course, I shoulda known better...","I'm a little upset, this got far more rambling and incoherent than I intended. But fuckin hell. It shouldn't be this hard. Not sure what I'm gonna do. Get blitzed outta my fuckin mind, depressed sleep 18 hours away, go for round 2,354., Walk into traffic. Deliver tired as fuck. Don't even know if I'm gonna call to check if GrubHub or Postmates package shit has arrivederci yet.
TLDR: UberEats went from a ""I'm only homeless for as long as I want to be homeless. It's completely up to me if i build the ladder to get out of this hole. The woods all here "" HOW DARE YOU HAVE BOOTSTRAPS"" in 3 seconds last night. My most profitable hours got stripped, for 6 hours, then they are going to add 4-5+ more hours to it cause NOW, after the break is up, I'm tired and want to sleep. Now I have to be homeless weeks longer cause some motherfuckin dumbass can't check his ego and decides to go way to long without being real with himself and do dumb shit.
They say to work hard and pull yourself up, then you try and do exactly that and get what can only be punishment and attempts to stop it thrown at ya. I live in my car. How do I solve this? Get money. I have a car. I can use car for money. Other people have money. Other people want shit, but don't have car to get it with. I use my car to bring them that shit, they give me money. Fuckin Perfect! Motherfuckers always wanting shit at all times of day and night too. I can sleep when people don't want shit to be fetched. I can do this shit day and night and knock some shit that needs knocking out, out real quick. Nope, you are not allowed to make money for 6 hours. It's for your safety. We're gonna force you to not work when you're not tired so that you start considering working when you are tired enough to have stopped otherwise and sleep ... for your safety. That's why it took me 22 hours to work 12 hours. Ihad so much good damn free time not working, I could slept if I wanted to be fucking sleeping. So youre gonna tell me I NEED a 6 hour break when I had 10 hours of fuckin break over the day. If I was tired I had PLENTY of opportunity to sleep. And not only THAT, you treat us just like employees when it's beneficial, and independent contractors when it doesn't. IF YOU ARE NOT GONNA PUT A MINIMUM WAGE INTO PLACE, DO NOT FUCKIN LIMIT MY HOURS. You're THAT asshole? I can make so little I can't survive, but do not fuckin make to much, well cap that shit. You want me to be an independent contractor? I make my own damn schedule then.
I'm forced 6 hours of lost income, at the highest boost rating over next days, during the one time period I actually can expect trips, cause probably nobody else is even working. What did they actually do? I'm only 27+ hours without sleep now, not refreshed and ready. Im now, once the break is starting to be done, tired enough to say Ima drive my fuckin car through their front door and not sure if I'm gonna depressed sleep go find drugs and get fucked beyond repair or just fucking go for round 2,35 fuckin 4.. JK. I wouldn't do that. And not to fuckin mention had I made 30$ during that 6 hour period, I was only 1-1 1/2 days from affording gas, phone bill AND a week of having a shower with a damn curtain and a roof without a moonroof. It's now a 3-4 day clusterfuck, that'll just prob turn itself into 7+ when I try to get there. I'm frankly at this point depressed and done. I was nearly bout to transition to weekly living that fuckin quick too. Blinded by hope and and wishes and like always, tried to make the depression the bad guy. He at least tells me what's gonna fuck happen. Don't listen to him telling you it's gonna get fucked over, and over, and over. Two days prior I had to completely reset from ground zero cause a tire shredded on me and needed to be replaced. And before that nearly lost phone service before I could even get started, because they took their sweet ass time with the background check and fucked about with my first weekly taking three weeks to get to me and not having the gas to do a single damn thing other than go to a gas station to get more gas. but magic fuckin jellybeans on that shit solving Can shit just TRY not to completely unravel for a fuckin minute. I can't do shit when I have to keep dealing with that shit. Any progress gets punted back to the start over, and over.
Postmates, GrubHub and shit use the block system, and as a new driver i can only work what is left for me, not what I'm willing to work. So they'll probably try to fuck with me too and give 2 hours a week or only let you work 5-8 hours a day, and I bet they all fuckin link so you can't get around time limits by using another one.
I deal with some MASSIVE depression disorder issues, I deal with PTSD, BPD, anxiety. I just got issues glued together to look human. I spent an entire fuckin day thinking I was handling this homeless situation like a boss and was gonna end it quicklike and it was not a happy situation. I was doing everything I could. Every fuckin trip, over 21 hours straight, hours researching and asking questions on how to be better, and make more than I am, signing up with services and shit to help me get out of homelessness.
I challenged the depression, and like fuckin always got bitch slapped into the ground because of it. I can't fuckin win, ever, I swear to Jesus mother of flyin flipping Christ. What is it about me that attracts this shit? You're situation has a mediocre amount of hope? There's not enough shit raining down on you then. I must have it far to fuckin good or something. That can't be happening. Two days ago a tire shredded on me. It was 3 months old. A baby tire. Not a nail, not a pothole, the tire just simply went to shit itself. Shit I can't control attacks me way to fuckin much. It's seriously impressive just how often the shit is happening. Three times in one week shits gotta try and keep the situation how it is.

A few thoughts/questions from a frequent NYC Uber Rider,"I work late a lot and my company pays for us to have a car service home and uber is one of the preferred vendors. I take an uber home 3-4x a week from midtown Manhattan to an outer borough. I also travel quite a bit and take ubers when I travel to and from airports. * I prefer Uber over the other ride sharing apps. As a woman I have luckily never had an issue with an uber driver and I take uber quite a bit. I have had issues with both lyft and via drivers. So bad that I had to get the police involved with the lyft incident and the way lyft handled the situation I vowed never to take them again unless there was no alternative.
* As a woman who does work in technology it was a lot for me to swallow when the post about how women technology employee are treated at uber. I started to take lyft but due to above mentioned issue I decided it was more important to me to ride with a company that seemed to care about my safety vs a company that blatantly didn't. And I'm not saying uber is perfect, I read the news just like you do, I'm just saying I had a beyond horrific experience with lyft. * I've been an uber customer since 2012. I first learned about them when I was in San Francisco for work in 2012 and there was a taxi strike or something going on and there was a 2-3 hour wait to get a taxi from the airport. I had to make a meeting and called my colleague and she told me about uber. I got a ride in less than 15 minutes, made my meeting and I was sold on the company. * I have a 4.8 rating and according to my expense system at work I have taken 383 uber rides in the past 18 months. I can't seem to see in the app how many I've actually taken because I know I've taken uber for non work reasons or reasons that I couldn't expense in the past 18 months. And before that we used a different expense system and it's too much work for me to go back and check. * I have had some really fascinating conversations with uber drivers especially when it comes to technology. * The uber app that drivers have - whatever routing/mapping tool it comes with sucks. I've learned to explain to the driver which way they need to go if they don't use waze or google maps. The uber app always takes them on the route with the most traffic and that's ass backwards.
* What happened to that uber pass thing - even though my company pays, I'd like to do a pass for 10$ it cut my costs in half and saved me even more when I took rides personally. * I have a disability and it would be great if I could put that in the app somewhere. I cannot climb into suburbans or escalades and frequently have to cancel them. It would be nice to be able to put a car preference. I know that drivers have the ability to enter stuff like this as the other day I got notified that my driver was hearing impaired. * It would be really nice to have scheduled rides guaranteed and I'd be fine with paying in advance. I scheduled an early ride to the airport a few weeks ago 2 days before and got an alert that no drivers were available and was credited $10. I have never had a problem before, I went in the app and requested a ride and a driver came in 12 minutes. I made my flight, but I'd really prefer a guaranteed trip. * Why so many cancellations lately? How does this work? For example, last week after I went out with friends I got an uber to go home at around 11 pm. I had 5 cancellations before I finally gave up and got in a regular taxi. I had a similar situation coming home from the airport not too long ago 3 or 4 cancellations until finally I got a ride. What's typically the reason drivers cancel? Do you get auto assigned the ride? If we as passengers cancel we get a fee, do drivers get a fee? * How does uber treat drivers vs the rest of the ride apps? * I've seen an uptick in the number of women drivers I've had. I had a really nice woman take me home yesterday and she was telling me that driving for uber allows her to stay home during the day with her son and then when her husband comes home she drives 2-3 evenings per week. Is there an initiative of having more women drivers? Or is this just something occurring?","I’m not a nyc driver, but her is my 2¢ on the difference between Lyft and Uber... Lyft starts with the letter L and Uber Starts with the letter U... after that they kinda just copycat each other. I do think Lyft has a little more interest in making a driver happy... like 4.8% of their care goes to making a driver happy where as Uber is 4.1% We (drivers) are certainly the most expendable element of the equation. But a few little differences go a long way, Lyft has US based driver support folks who are usually really nice to deal with, where as Uber’s are all based in India... and at 2:30 in the morning after a pax has threatened to punch you because you won’t take 6 people in your 4 pasenger car... that makes a big difference. Also about Uber’s supposed driver support, they sometimes don’t understand what you are telling them even though they repeat the question 3-4 times back to you. If they don’t have it written on their cue card, they don’t know what to do...
Take a similar situation, I had a group of 6 obviously early teens try to get me to take them on a ride with 6 passengers in my still 4 person ride. The app lets me select why I’m canceling the ride, I put too many passengers, but also wanted to warn Uber that they were 13-14-15 years old. And most likely trying to get into some real trouble. Thankfully I waited to start the ride after it went from 2 to 3 to 4 to 6 passengers none more than 15 years old. After canceling that ride I called Uber, 1) took 20-30 mins to connect. And then after I told the guy that it was 6 minors trying to take a 4 person ride he was like, “yes, you are not allowed to take more than 4 people on an X ride... I’m like yes, I understand that, I want Uber to know that these are minors trying to use the service to get rides. He says “no, under age minors are not allowed to take a ride.” And I say, you should mark it so that they won’t order another ride and give another driver the ability to drive underage riders.

Mturk while traveling in another country?,"Hi I have been living abroad the past year. My previous visa allowed me to work but now it has been downgraded as I am moving back to the US, so the visa says I cannot work. I was turking a little bit while the work visa was still valid and earned like 150 dollars.
As much as I love this country I really don't want to figure out how to report this small amount to them. I also would like to continue some light turking (maybe around 300 a month) but I don't want to deal with any taxes or government stuff in this country. Of course I will report the turking to the US for taxes but I have no idea how it works here.
I would just not report it but I am disabled and get SSDI. I have to submit income to them through the embassy. I don't know if they would report this to the government of the country that I am in.

A driver tried to force me into human trafficking. Help what do I do?,"I emailed uber, and posted to their Facebook about this. All I’m getting is a generic “we’ll investigate this matter and take this seriously” response. On Feb. 24 I took a ride home from a popular LGBT club alone. The driver began asking me personal sexual questions and commented several times he’d make so much money off of me. Then he suddenly stopped and a big guy got in the front seat. I was so scared and I froze and didn’t know what to do. He sped off and they both talked about it and the new passenger said he wasn’t interested but he knew some people that would be. When we stopped at a stop sign I tried to leave the car and they physically grabbed my arm and forced me to stay in the car. They drove and I dialed 911 and told them I was calling at this point because I was afraid that A. I would be killed and B. That I would be kidnapped. They took my threat seriously and drove to my house at around 3:30 AM and warned me if I reported it they would come after me as they now knew where I lived. I took this very seriously and didn’t tell anybody, not even my husband. I’ve kept this in and it’s basically ruined my life. I’ve since re-developed my eating disorder, and began to self-harm after years of recovery. 2 days ago it was announced that they have changed their policies and added a 911 feature that alerts your emergency contacts. I am also moving in a month to another state and I feel this is the time to come forward because not only for me but also anyone else they could have done this too.

A few questions about turking while on SSDI,"I'd like to get into this to earn a little extra income, but I'm afraid of making things complicated with Social Security!

2. How do I report the type of work that I'm doing? I'm not technically an Amazon employee, but they'll want to know who I was working for... not to mention an hourly rate (which of course varies wildly by task)!

$5 driver cancel scam?,"Visiting Chicago for 2 days. We've used Uber twice in today tried Lyft. We were outside the hotel door by the street and and set up a ride. A lady responded and accepted the ride. It said three minutes away. Not even 20 seconds later it said I ride was cancelled. Mind you she was about two and a half blocks away. We looked at the ride and it said we were charged $5 for canceling.
We never canceled though, she did. She never even made it to the hotel because we watched for her very specific car and license plate. Mind you our trip was 22 minutes away. I read online drivers do this when they find out the destination is too far. So obviously it's a scam because I assume they make that $5 even though they cancelled.
I'm sad to see drivers are saying they do this because the money they barely make is not a worth it for that distance. Well I get that it is not fair to screw over to be passengers. All that does is make your passengers not want to use your service anymore. Everyone knows driving for Uber and Lyft doesn't pay. Admittedly that sucks. But you need to take it up with them and not hurt the passengers because when you cancel why would they want you to get a raise after you screwed them over.
That said when we requested the ride again we got a very friendly guy he said drivers cancelling is a common thing. When he brought us to our destination we gave him ten bucks as a tip. This lady would have just taken us she could have gotten that tip. Granted I realized most people aren't going to tip much if anything at all.
In the end I do hope you guys get paid more because your current pay it's not worth it. I personally cannot drive because I'm disabled and I always tip well. Hopefully they will run across somebody like me who gives you a good tip and makes it feel like not all hope is lost","Couple of things make your post unbelievable.
1. It is impossible for a driver to collect a cancel fee without both arriving to your pin and waiting 5 minutes.
2. Passengers can cancel a ride within the first minute of ordering and not be charged any fee whatsoever.

The tale of the humpback!,"This might be long. 
 Get a call from Diamond! I was excited because it's usually one of the ladies of the night or maybe the strip club! They always tip $20.00, even on a bad night they still give you a $3 tip! I get there and it turns out not to be any of my regular ladies.   
It was 3 beautiful ladies, they were dressed in African attire, looking so beautiful, so many different colors of the rainbow, yellow, red, maroon, burgundy. One of them I could tell had a slight hump back and walked with a limp. I felt bad for her right away because people with disabilities work extra hard. 
 As they got into my car, I noticed that the lady with the humpback wasn't getting into the car correctly. She was literally leaning all the way over but for some reason couldn't put her knees up, I thought maybe it was due to her disability.  
 They all got in, one in the front and the other two in the back, then I asked them their names and ask them to all click their seatbelts. The lady with the hump on her back didn't move. I turned around and I told her ""you are precious cargo, I must make sure I get you there in one piece please click your seatbelt"".   
She had a little waist so I knew it would be no problem to bring that belt down and bring it across your waist. She looked at me funny.   
At that moment she grabbed the cloth of her dress and pulled it around and her hump on her back moved to her side but as it moved to her side it also started kicking! Right at that moment I thought to myself WTF! She had a baby wrapped up in her dress!   
 I looked at her and said ""lady your hump is moving viciously and has moved to the side of your underarm! The lady in the front giggled!  
 At that moment I asked the ladies did they have a car seat for the baby! All three of them shook their heads no in unison. I asked them to please step out of the car and that I could not take them with a baby with no car seat.   
As they were climbing out of the car and I was letting the timer run out I started laughing hysterically and I couldn't stop.
 I got a message while I was waiting it was the lady asking me to hurry up and cancel the ride so that she could call another car right away because I was holding her up.   
I didn't answer,  I just let the time run out. I called CS and ask them to unpair me and let them know about the baby with no car seat and even the little customer service guy begin to laugh at the story.

"Recruiting drivers with chronic illnesses/disabilities ($20, confidential interview)","Hi folks,
I'm a researcher at Cornell University, and I'm conducting a study on experiences with gig work for people with chronic illnesses and/or disabilities. If you drive for Lyft/Uber, have a chronic illness/disability, and live in the U.S., you’re eligible to take part.
Interviews take approximately 60 minutes, and participants will receive $20 USD for their time and insight (either via Amazon gift card or PayPal). The interviews are confidential and no identifying information will be collected. Interviews are usually audio-only, but we’re happy to accommodate any accessibility needs (such as a text-based interview).
This study is approved by Cornell’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). You can see more information here: https://cornell.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_esyBHFzpRn8hxmR

A message to Uber and Lyft,"I have severe asthma. I did not try to get the sick pay because i realized very early on unless you were directly exposed or tested positive you were not getting paid. If you had an underlining medical condition but did not test postive or were not directly exposed you were not getting paid. Ive worked the last 14 days stright, 9 hours a day to afford my bills. Thank god I could just do UberEats instead of giving rides. Im still kind of scared. Im so tired. Im so happy I get to take a day off tommrow. I just wanna say somthing.

No one can afford to not pay rent. No one can afford the late fees. We dont have medical insurance. We dont have sick pay or PTO. I get it we are ""independent contractors"" but you deactivate and deny people sick pay that you offered in the first place? How if someone tells you they have a serious underling medical condition could you do that?  DEACTIVATE THEM AND NOT PAY THEM. Your day of reckoning will come Uber and Lyft. And when the lawsuits start flaying after all the dusts has settled you will be begging to pay that sick pay and if drivers start dying on your platform because you refused to pay them and they kept driving.... be ready to see how fast a judge throws out that arbitration agreement.

I'm an addict in recovery and am also disabled. My biggest barrier to staying clean has always been free time, but because of my disability, I'm unable to do traditional work.

The New Gig Act - Big Techs’ Agenda On Labor Rights,"This November, Members of Congress and Senate are finally taking an in-depth look at how Big Tech Lobbyists (e.g. Uber and Lyft) are creating, not changing, labor laws on a state-by-state level. These Big Tech companies have been successful in lobbying both republicans and democrats in creating identical “templated” bills to introduce for lawmaking. These templated bills carry very identical verbiage.
A r[eport](https://www.nelp.org/publication/marketplace-platforms-employers-state-law-reject-corporate-solutions-support-worker-led-innovation/) by the National Employment Law Project expresses that the “bills have passed in Arizona (2017), Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Utah (2018). They were defeated in Alabama, California, Colorado, and Georgia.” These templates for state bills are written in a very peculiar manner as they deem all independent contractors as “marketplace contractors” and the “company” (e.g. Uber/Lyft) as a “marketplace platform.”
But this was not enough for the publicly traded companies (e.g.Uber, Lyft, and others). A report by the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/economy/gig-economy-lobbying.html?fbclid=IwAR1nkexBKXsdtV8bWOju1JVSv9V36aztE1Sg9o7aOunttmOyKmFZe1WJqec) explains how a Big Tech Lobbyist by the name of Bradley Tusk started lobbying state agencies (non-elected officials) for rules that prevent “workers” from qualifying for Unemployment Insurance and Workers Compensation Insurance.
### Uber Messed with Texas and They Won
During 2019, in Texas, there was a successful and [secretive operation](https://www.texasobserver.org/are-silicon-valley-giants-responsible-for-a-mysterious-new-texas-labor-rule/) performed by Big Data/Big Tech [Lobbyists](https://www.texasobserver.org/handy-wanted-to-disrupt-texas-labor-laws-it-may-have-also-disrupted-texas-lobbying-laws/). The objective was to strip away Texas Uber/Lyft [drivers’ legal labor rights](https://www.nelp.org/publication/rights-at-risk-gig-companies-campaign-to-upend-employment-as-we-know-it/) regarding qualification to apply for unemployment insurance. As reported [by Texas Observer](https://www.texasobserver.org/are-silicon-valley-giants-responsible-for-a-mysterious-new-texas-labor-rule/) and [expanded by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/business/economy/gig-economy-lobbying.html?fbclid=IwAR1nkexBKXsdtV8bWOju1JVSv9V36aztE1Sg9o7aOunttmOyKmFZe1WJqec), the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) Chair and Commissioner, Ruth Hughs, now promoted by Greg Abbott to the Texas Secretary of State, seems to have been secretly worked with Big Tech/Big Data [Lobbyists](https://www.texasobserver.org/handy-wanted-to-disrupt-texas-labor-laws-it-may-have-also-disrupted-texas-lobbying-laws/) to rewrite state labor rules (i.e. [TWC Rules](https://twc.texas.gov/files/agency/pr-ch-815-status-test-approved-12-4-18-twc.pdf)).
The TWC rule's verbiage of [“marketplace platform” and “marketplace contractors”](https://twc.texas.gov/files/agency/pr-ch-815-status-test-approved-12-4-18-twc.pdf) mirrors other existing templates and bills which this TWC rule asserts that Texas Uber and Lyft drivers are independent contractors with no labor rights. This successful attempt to bypass state legislation basically rewrote the Texas Law, [HB 100](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00100F.htm) (signed by the Governor Greg Abbott back in 2017), pertaining to Technology Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Lyft. It is important to note that HB 100 was passed in a bipartisan fashion via extensive lobbying and money spent by Lyft and Uber. This rule was a [blatant disregard for the common law](https://twc.texas.gov/files/businesses/form-c-8-employment-status-comparative-approach-twc.pdf), and the rule change was created by appointed seats, not by elected officials.
This new ruling in place prevents a “marketplace contractor” or better to say “worker” from challenging their misclassification as independent contractors at the state's highest courts; via appealing TWC Unemployment Insurance based on misclassification of drivers.

>*The danger here is that businesses can change their business model to conform to these “marketplace” rules and forego any employers’ obligations to basic labor rights.*
After many years of lobbying at the city, [state](http://info.tpj.org/Lobby_Watch/pdf/UberLyft2017.pdf), and federal levels, Lyft went public at a [$24 billion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/lyft-stock-how-valuation-compares-to-other-tech-names-at-ipo-2019-4-1028090958) valuation and Uber’s I.P.O. was valued at [$82.4 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/technology/uber-ipo-stock-price.html). But is their business model sustainable? For Example, In Houston, a regular Uber worker earns $0.60 a mile and the [IRS depreciates/deducts a vehicle at $0.58 a mile](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-standard-mileage-rates-for-2019). The driver earns a gross profit of two cents a mile. This is not a sustainable or logical business model, its a cashflow model for drivers while the company’s shareholders make a profit.
### 
### The New Gig Act

>*So, what is the IRS gaining from taxes, when the driver is writing off all his or her miles which are two cents below the drivers' earnings.*
This November, U.S. Senator John Thune (R- S.D.)[ a member of the Tax-Writing](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/7/thune-introduces-bill-to-add-certainty-to-worker-classification-rules) Senate Finance Committee reintroduced the [New Gig Act](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/38a75133-d17b-4f56-b115-c9d9e12c218d/7BE74BFDFC4E90C39BD625D6BCD3ED81.ott19128.pdf). It is reported by the [Yahoo Finance that Uber and Lyft ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-lyft-spending-big-bucks-100721856.html)are spending a lot of money defeating the New Gig Act; but bills have a way of starting off with good intentions and eventually conform to corporation “experts” recommendation as the ""shot callers"" for the New Gig Economy. Congress used to have industry experts, but now they solely rely on corporations to be the industry experts and self-regulate themselves which these big tech companies have armies of lawyers at their disposal.
The New Gig Act is also sponsored by Tom Rice (R- S.C.), it is hard to believe the Bill’s summary seen [here](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/bf95aba5-3a6a-4012-b3dc-6d6531d5e329/EEE0ACEAA61960DE697BFA4D9F776BD7.bill-summary-s.-700.pdf) will be tainted on its way up the legislative branch. The [Bill](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/38a75133-d17b-4f56-b115-c9d9e12c218d/7BE74BFDFC4E90C39BD625D6BCD3ED81.ott19128.pdf) seems to favor workers' rights on face value, but these things have a way of changing. So pardon me if I am skeptical and cynical.
Uber and Lyft seem to be heading into an infection point in their business model, and the shareholder will realize that the business model is not feasible. Even the National Labor Relations Board (i.e. appointed seats) [are attacking workers’ rights](https://www.epi.org/publication/unprecedented-the-trump-nlrbs-attack-on-workers-rights/) via the peculiar Joint Employer Ruling ([see dissent on page 22](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-19930.pdf)).
Perhaps drivers should list Uber as an employer on their 2019 tax form.

He Had a Stroke - My Uber driver story,"**He Had a Stroke**
I generally don’t get the chance to drive in the morning, but when I do, I find people are generally just going about their business. To a meeting, to school, back from the train station. You get the picture. Today was different when I was pinged by the app to go pickup at the hospital. A middle-aged gentleman was waiting outside, which I always appreciate. The uncertainty of driving for an app is always put at ease when a friendly face is standing there waiting for you. The human connection is always nice to see and I much prefer it to a computer telling me when and where to show up.
We started to talk about the weather. The art of small talk is something I believe I have mastered, but my most interesting rides are always the ones that go far past these social norms. The conversation turned sharply as he said that he did not get to see much of the winter this year. My mind rushed to a long-term winter escape. Florida perhaps. So, silly me, I asked away.
“Did you get away for the winter? Lucky you!”.
“No, unfortunately not. I was in the hospital. You see, I had a stroke”.
Knowing very little about strokes or really what to even say, I wished him well in his recovery. We chatted about life, the recovery time, the agony of the doctor’s uncertainty. When could he return to work? Is this even in the cards any more? His entire being had changed in one moment. I suppose life is just a string of how we are doing today, this week, this month, this year. We forget how terrible it used to be when we struggled with a situation or event. With a medical issue, the loss of your first boyfriend or girlfriend, or even how shitty homework was to do in high school. Humans forget too easily and perhaps this is a helpful coping mechanism.

Collection of bizarre wtf incidents that happened to me as an Uber driver in Minneapolis.,"So Holierthanthee woman thought I'm likely not even an Unexpected driver.  So I will share with you guys my past incidents, some I have on dashcam and most are not on YouTube and backed up to Cloud. But here goes.  These are in order going from recent and backwards.  I'll make them short so I don't tire your eyes with reading as I know time as valuable for you. Been a driver since 2015 with Lyft and Uber.
> Picked up a young working Engineer professional from his luxury condo and when we got to his girls house he said ""Ozzy can I ask you a question,?"", And I was like it doesn't sound right when you have to ask permission to ask question.  Then he said ""Is it ok if I sucked your dick?"".  I told him your girl is waiting for me, sorry am not gay.
------------------------------
>Picked up 2 older women from that same condo of that guy who asked me if he can suck my dick, and they never said anything anything when they got in car (100%) of my pax always at least greet or say hi, and I say Welcome with happy smile.  I arrive at their destination and one of them starts saying with a cold attitude ""I need you to drop me off right in front of door, align me with door"".  She wasn't handicap or very old, so I was surprised and did so anyways.  And materials see a 1 star.  I think they have been through problems with other drivers so they are hostile to new drivers.
-----------------------------------
>I've done thousand airport rides with past cars and pax man gets in car from left side and moves over to very far right and he never shut door, I was like wtf? I asked him will you close door? Maybe he was thinking this is some Limo service where we open and shut doors.  Door was wide open and he finally reached over to shit it.
----------------------------
> Picked up Pax man from Mystic Lake Casino without surge and he told me he just lost $3,000 at Casino and that he also waited 40 mins for Uber surge to go away.  His distance was a $60 distance had it been surge and $27 without surge.  I told him the area is very hard to find a driver since it is one. Reservation far away, so I was under the impression he would actually be greatful for a ride and allow surge like there is no tomorrow.  But apparently it is ok to lose $3k to a Casino, but not to an Uber.

>This one comes with a YouTube dash cam.  https://youtu.be/XFw9EeWOurg
I picked up some newlyweds from Uptown Minneapolis, and they had another guy with me.  Both guys were huge and can kick my ass if they wanted to, but on with the story 
Woman grabs my charger from my own phone, disconnects it and then thinks she can plug my own android charger into her own phone.  I told her (without yelling or raising my voice that she just grabbed my own charger and that she should ask first) in YouTube video you can hear on dashcam I am playing nice music from my phone and am mumbling music and other stuff cuz it is end of my shift and I'm tired, but the woman started getting defensive as if I offended her when in fact she offended me and she just would not stop talking to me even though I let go of the matter, I was trying to be patient and making sure my own end of shift tiredness wasn't affecting my judgement with this incident that is unfolding for this last ride that took me on very good surge to near my mom's house.  The woman just would not give up so I told her man who is sitting in back, can you please tell your woman to stop talking to me as this isn't her ride and we are do are talking? And then he initially sided with me and he even said ""that bitch show shut up"" he called his own newly wed wife a bitch.   I think alcohol was making her over confident and she wasn't aware I as an Uber can throw them all out in a Jiffy on the cold winter freeway, but I am not the type to strand fellow citizens.  The her man sided with her and told me ""I'm gonna report you to Uber"", at which point I kicked them out and other taller guy with them was begging me to take him when he came to my window, I said sorry man some bad incident occured here so I can't, just crash with them as they brought you along. 
------------------------------------------------
> Picked up a man around late 40s or 50s who was dressed nice and looked like your average father of your average American family.   He told me he just got kicked out of Uptown because they thought he didn't fit in, and then when we got on freeway toward nearby city where he was going he asked me ""You're not sending the drug dealers to associate me are you?"".  I told him do you want me to kick you out for telling me that or are you having some sort of medical issue or do you need soda to get blood sugar back or something? He started apologizing so I just dropped him off to his destination.",N/A,N/A,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/apa8r1/collection_of_bizarre_wtf_incidents_that_happened/,uberdrivers,"disorder|disability|SSI|SSDI|""I'm disabled""|""medical condition""|""medical issue""|""chronic pain""",apa8r1,2019-02-10,1,0,ActualFunny,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
My hacked account story.,"I write this as a word of caution to anyone considering using doordash. Perhaps their business practices have changed, but I will personally never use them again.
A few weeks ago, I got an email that my doordash account email and password had been changed. I tried to log on to my account immediately, but was obviously unable to. That's when I checked my credit card. Over $100 racked up in a matter of minutes, and my $50 in referral credit vanished. Needless to say, I was pissed and canceled my card immediately. I have no doubt they would've kept ordering had I not.
I called Doordash and spoke to an agent with a heavy accent. I have significant hearing loss, so trying to understand her was nearly impossible. The best she offered was to deactivate my account, but I don't know if she ever understood that my account had been hacked by a stranger as opposed to me just wanting to cancel. She told me to contact my bank for a refund, which I did shortly after.
In a series of 10-15 emails over the next few weeks, I detailed how I wanted my referral credit back, and that I really needed to speak to someone without an accent due to my disability. This was not to be insulting to any of their employees, but conversations with their staff were nearly impossible for me. Every time I hung up I would burst into tears, and every email I received was generic and always ended with ""we'll get back to you asap!"" Everyone I spoke to had a thick accent, and every email was vague. They eventually began to say my account never existed in the first place....which was frustrating in a way I can't even begin to describe. 
In the end, nobody ever admitted my account was hacked, nobody ever gave me my referral credit back, and I never got a single apology.",N/A,N/A,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/a3eqd3/my_hacked_account_story/,doordash,"disorder|disability|SSI|SSDI|""I'm disabled""|""medical condition""|""medical issue""|""chronic pain""",a3eqd3,2018-12-05,1,0,sexappealandpancakes,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Uber Customers, Must Read This First Before Using This Group","Keep in mind that Uber is created FOR CUSTOMERS not for drivers, and there’s a big difference. Many customers are literally living with disabilities, and these types of app services WERE CREATED BY GOD’S Spirit to make their lives easier, and especially to help people living in poverty or on SSI to live more affordably & comfortably.
Just a warning to everyone, the moderator here is a disgruntled Internet psychopath who has purposefully created a community which fosters drivers to complain about Uber all day long, encouraging drivers to literally complain about customers & tips all day long, and to even harass customers for posting here for any “reason” they wish.
The moderator is not a real professional, and even insults & harasses customers for defending themselves against many miserable “drivers” … You know, the random people with cars & a cell phone who decide to take your life & needs into their hands, only to complain about your tips & to harass you for having a voice. These random people with cell phones who didn’t go to college are allowed to insult you, harass you, and gang up on you as well as complain about your tipping system & worthiness to make use of a service that was invented FOR YOU.
If a customer so much as dislikes a single thing about Uber & voices it, they will gang up on them and tell them “THEN QUIT USING UBER NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO JESUS”.  They will try to shame you from using services created for you, insult people with disabilities, trigger you, complain about you, slander you as being someone who doesn’t appreciate or deserve a service that was made for you, and then if you defend yourself the moderator will take these scumbag drivers’ sides loitering the group to insult you & ban YOU.
Think twice about hanging out here, because the moderator is a worthless piece of shit who has created a community of miserable spoiled self-righteous & self-entitled high school dropouts who leech of the Uber business so they don’t have to answer to a boss, fostering them to bully and bash people with disabilities & allowing them to run the narrative & community.
This place is a piece of shit and so is the moderator. Make sure you recognize before proceeding, because I assure this has been happening for years; you can look back in the logs and old threads where drivers are constantly harassing & complaining about customers, then if customers defend themselves the moderator will demonize the victims for his little “frat” hangout while he trolls the Internet behind reddit privileges. He’s a pathetic disgusting lowlife & doesn’t care even the slightest about your rights or feelings.",N/A,N/A,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/g7jd58/uber_customers_must_read_this_first_before_using/,UberEATS,"disorder|disability|SSI|SSDI|""I'm disabled""|""medical condition""|""medical issue""|""chronic pain""",g7jd58,2020-04-24,0,0,lucinogenic,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
So Kyoto has no Uber service...,"Decided to take a taxi. Big mistake.
Driver is at least 75 years old, hearing aid and coke bottle glasses, the whole works.
He had no idea where I wanted to go. I literally spent 10 minutes on Google maps showing him where this place is, a mere 5 kilometers away.
Driver has some kind of neurological disorder where he can't press the brake even, only in jerky stomps? Most uncomfortable ride ever.
And I can't pay through an app, cash only.
Kyoto is an amazing city, but I sure wish it had Uber!",N/A,N/A,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/8symd4/so_kyoto_has_no_uber_service/,uber,"disorder|disability|SSI|SSDI|""I'm disabled""|""medical condition""|""medical issue""|""chronic pain""",8symd4,2018-06-22,0,0,Anen-o-me,0,,,0,,,Agree,0,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
