POST TITLE: Attention Dashers!! One of our own has recently been HUMILIATED and ROBBED on Twitter. Doordash has yet to comment on the matter.
A video with nearly 2 million views posted on Twitter shows two boys harassing a Dasher, forcing him to pay out of pocket in order to give them their refund.
Link to video: https://mobile.twitter.com/j_baylorcook/status/1071575501590941698
As far as I can tell, the customers had ordered ice cream from McDonald’s, as well as some other food. Not surprisingly the ice cream machine from McDonald’s was out of order. The dasher let the customers know that McDonald’s was unable to complete the full order, and that they would be receiving a refund for their ice cream FROM Doordash itself. The customers complain and RECORD the whole ordeal, and basically force the Dasher to pay the refund out of his own pocket!!! 
Guys we’ve all been there, and obviously the Dasher could have just refused to pay them the refund. If you watch the video it is pretty obvious that these two kids just wanted a viral video. Also I hate to make rash judgements but it definitely seems like the poor young man has some kind of social disorder. Give the video a watch and let me know what you think. 
I find it ridiculous that Doordash has yet to comment on the situation, the least they could do is defend the guy. With nearly 2 million views it seems that Doordash simply does not care about its workers.

	This is why the Rating System is bullshit, driver probably gave into
	those teens demands because he didn’t want to get rated poorly. The
	system basically wants you to kiss customers asses and follow their
	terrorist demands. Also this video proves why we should never carry
	cash, even though Doordash advises us to for cash tippers. Hopefully
	the driver got compensated back, these teens learned a early life
	lesson and DD have better driver support

	When I did doordash I would always cancel anytime I got to the
	restaurant and something like this was wrong with the order. It
	wasn't worth the trouble. I also never paid for anything out of
	pocket.  And if for whatever reason Doordash owes you money and
	refuses to pay up I suggest you bring documentation to your local DD
	rep. I did this once when they reneged on a bonus offer. They were
	offering 50 bucks to do 20 orders "from Friday to Sunday" when I
	asked support to pay up they claimed that Saturday orders didn't
	count because apparently "Friday to Sunday" is not the same as
	"Friday, Saturday and Sunday." I printed out the emails from DD
	support and took them to the local office. I had the money by the end
	of the day.

I made a [post](https://redd.it/4652q7) a week ago about myself. That I'm disabled and I turk in my spare time, and whenever my stiffness allows me to. I'm nowhere close to a pro or have the knowledge to be. I have around 5500 HITs which actually took a very long time to assemble.
But today I beat my own record for the day. Obviously google HITs helped. I made $65.42 and submitted 442 HITs. For me that's much more than my usual $15-20.

POST TITLE: Dash anxiety
Anyone else have major anxiety before they start dashing? Any tips on how to ease it/overcome it? For instance, my first dash always makes me sweat, my heart pounds, I over think everything. What if the customer is scary? What if I can't find their house? What if they yell at me about their food? What if this order is a human trafficking scam? What if the restaurant takes gives me the wrong food and I don't realize it until I'm driving? What if the app fuck in anyway? What if the cops pull me over because of my expired inspection sticker? What if what if what if?
But then usually by the end of the night I don't feel as bad. But lately I've been talking myself out of going to work and just sleeping all day and telling myself I'll dash all day tomorrow, which I rarely ever do. When I do dash I usually dash at 7pm-11-30pm. Idk why I'm like this. I'm in debt and I can't hold down a real job because not only do I have generalized anxiety disorder I also suffer from ptsd, major depressive disorder and chronic migraines...I'm starting to feel suicidal and I'm seeing a therapist. Oh boy. Sorry if I ranted too much. Don't have any friends to support me.

	I get super bad anxiety too before starting a dash or any job for
	that matter. I just go through every possible situation and how bad
	things can go, which is terrible, then I go through each of them
	again and remind myself the reality of what would actually happen.
	Ex: if I mess up an order, yeah the person might yell at me or give
	me a bad rating, but so what? That’s the worst that could happen. I
	usually feel better after making myself be more realistic. Or a whole
	other method is to just not think about it at all, give urself no
	time to think and just press dash now. Force urself to start and then
	it’s not bad. The less you think the better (for anxiety). And about
	ur suicidal thoughts, I’ve been there man ur not alone, but please
	don’t go through with it. The best decision I ever made was to not
	kill myself. If u need to take a long ass break from doordash, do it.
	Nothing is as important as mental health or just being alive in the
	first place. Worst case scenario, u can’t pay rent and u go stay with
	someone or just be homeless, but it’s way better than being dead.
	Life is amazing, it’s far more than just work :) good luck

	I like to look up the address in google maps while I’m waiting for
	the food. About 20% of the time google tells me I have delivered
	there before (there is a little clock that pops up to the left of the
	address to indicate this). I know if I have been there before,
	everything was fine and I should easily find the place again and the
	people weren’t lunatics.  I also do this to get an image of what to
	look for (google generally has the street views available) when
	delivering and sometimes I can count how many houses from a corner a
	house is. When I started I had a few nightmare deliveries where I
	couldn’t find the house or rang the wrong doorbell and that still
	gives me a lot of anxiety (I have over 1000 deliveries over a year
	and a half).  I will also only dash in the same zone because I am
	familiar with restaurants, neighborhoods, and most important-
	apartment complexes! The thought of trying to dash in another zone is
	crippling to me.  It also really helps me to keep this job in
	perspective. It’s not my company - if a customer is unhappy or the
	order is wrong, it’s not like I’m personally responsible. Once I’m
	back to my car, I basically wash my hands of it. I do my best to
	deliver accurately and quickly but I don’t deal with customer calls
	afterwards because again, not my problem.  It’s not going on my
	resume. If I screw up enough I can find another gig. Even the unhappy
	customers have a very small impact on my ratings, if they even choose
	to rate at all.

	Just do one delivery, no matter how bad you feel. If after that first
	delivery, you still feel the same way, then just log off and call it
	a day. That's the great thing about this job - there is zero
	requirement to finish your shift. Hell, you can even unassign after
	you get to the restaurant if you feel so inclined.  Then sit back and
	remember "If this were a real job, I'd have a boss judging me and
	yelling at me, and zero option to leave". In reality you are self-
	employed with this job - you set the rules, the hours, the jobs you
	choose to take, and how you do the work. It's ok to decline orders -
	especially if it's going to a crowded shithead bar or places like
	that. You are in control here far more than any other regular job -
	take full advantage of that! Also - human trafficking? Curious to

Obviously I'm not an authorized law enforcement officer, public health, or government official. I am a driver. If you click I am a driver it just takes you to the normal "issue with a trip?" Page.

POST TITLE: Any advice on inebriation report?
My husband has been an Uber driver for a few months and just this morning found his account suspended for someone reporting inebriated driving. He's very meticulous about not driving while inebriated but he's got some behavioral quirks from a disability that will make him appear inebriated. This is the first time anyone has complained about it to Uber. I was wondering if anyone here might have some advice or experience similar situation.

	It is kinda crazy someone can so easily be deactivated.  Anyways
	though, how is someone "very meticulous about not driving while
	inebriated"? You don't have to try all that hard to drive sober.
	Sounds like something someone would say about an alcoholic? Don't
	mean to be a jerk, but that just sounded strange to me.  Seems like
	any pax could ultimately dislike a driver and do this to anyone,
	couldn't they? We better start stocking our cars with champagne and

POST TITLE: I feel like I'm going nowhere with this site, depressed, no money and suicidal
I was just browsing the mturk members page on Facebook and there was so many people who were all saying they made over $300 yesterday, They of course didnt say who it was they worked for and I guess I should of expected this, this makes me feel like I dont even know what I'm doing on Mturk and I feel like a a total piece of shit for wasting so much time on here, I set here for hours and hours and I make around $5 an hour while they seemingly have it easy. I assume all these groups of ppl have closed quals? But I have gone far and wide to search out closed quals and even did every one on qualifeye on turkrview weeks ago and regularly check it for updates. So what am I missing?, I have been in a very tough situation life wise and I'm still waiting for disability to see if I can get disability benefits, I suffer from chronic depression and PTSD from my army days. So really the kind of work I can do is very very limited to only stuff I can do from home. I wanna use Mturk to help pay for bills too, not just depend on the kindness of my family, who are paying my bills until I get approved for disability. Until then I'm literally living off my friends money and that just makes me feel even more depressed because I feel like I totally failed at life to the point to where I have to depend on other ppl to pay my bills. I lost my true self, my independence. 
I will prob just delete this post, but I need to rant, when you post about your large daily earnings your not encouraging other ppl, your just making them (me) feel worthless, like were not even doing mechanical turk properly. I wish I could jus hit $30 a day without having to sit around for 6+ hours to do so. its absolutely depressing and boring just looking at HIT finder thinking "I wonder if Im gonna be able to catch that hit". and 90% of the stuff I click accept on gets taken.

	First off, if you are suicidal in any way, seek immediate help for
	that.  Nothing on this forum will help you turn that mindset around
	and that is much more serious than feeling bad about mturk. As far as
	my experience, I started a little over two years ago and the posts
	with higher earnings had an opposite effect, it motivated me to get
	better and let me know that it was possible.  I realize that everyone
	thinks differently, but it may help to see it from that perspective.
	Some other tips if you can only work from home. 1)  When it is slow
	on mturk look for closed quals.   Masters is out of a worker's
	control, but anyone can find a good closed qualification.  Look at
	every new hit that comes out and read the instructions to see if it
	is a hit that leads to other ones.   Some qualification hits are low
	in pay but worth it if you get them.   Some are a lot of money, some
	one time deals for a few dollars, but they add up. 2)  Apply to Appen
	or Lionbridge.  Both are part time at home work with set hourly
	rates.  I have some work from Appen and it is nice to know that there
	is a given base of money coming in every week regardless of how
	things are on mturk 3)  Add other platforms.   Clickworker,
	Microworker, Prolific and Qmee are examples.   It is easier to have
	money coming in when you have multiple sources to pick from.   Just
	avoid platforms that pay in cryptocurrency or have a high minimum
	cash out. 4)  Compete against yourself.   You probably will rarely or
	never get that 1000 week or 300 dollar day, but it you set goals to
	beat your previous day, week or month, you will find yourself
	gradually going up and seeing more money come in. Keep your chin up.
	Thank you for your service to the country and Best of luck to you.

	Third, there are now a number of organizations which purport to help

	I'm relatively new too, but one thing that helped me was getting the
	Mturk Suite extension. It takes a little getting used to but with it
	you can set it to "Catch" HITs so you don't have to manually get
	them. Also, it seems like it might be most busy around the usual
	business hours, 9am-5pm (if you're in the US). For me, the most money
	is coming from surveys. Also, try to keep your approval ratings up,
	if possible at 99%. Hope this maybe helps a little? Edit: Another
	suggestion is maybe write to some of the people re: qualifications.
	Sometimes all you need to do is be nice and ask. Like PickFu is good
	with that, in my experience. Also, once you reach certain milestones

	use the site as a way to motivate you in the sense that you're
	earning something on a daily basis. Take the bad days with the good,

So right now I'm balls deep into a 5 day semi-timed HIT from AARC. I have to do one today (Wed, 8AM) or skip if I can't and redo tomorrow, I think. Because I'm disabled I usually get up at 9 (I am very sore and stiff before.) 
So I grab my iPad and enter the URL. The HIT works but halfway through the survey I can't mark off the answers. After some colorful swearing and quick searching for other downloadable browsers, I make an exception and get up early.
I go to my PC because I still haven't returned the HIT and look in my dashboard. Says "no currently assigned HITs". WTF.
The stipulations are an "hour" from the assigned time. Even if that means 30min each way I should still have had time!

POST TITLE: Low rating for not talking
So why do passengers think it’s appropriate to rate drivers low because the driver did not initiate conversation with the passenger?  One person rated me as a 2 star drive, and marked communication as the reason why.  This was after he mistakenly sent me somewhere else and had to drive another 5 minutes away to him.  This isn’t the first time either just the most recent.  I always say “hello” or “how are you” at the start of the trip yet it still happens.  I have autism which makes it harder for me to talk so it just feels like I’m getting rated low because of my disability.  I’m in the dangerous ratings zone where I could potentially be kicked off as a driver yet can’t raise my rating because people either don’t rate or rate me low because I’m not talking or something.  I know I’m not the best driver (almost been in one accident on a snowy road so I understand that low rating, for example) but 90%+ of my drives are perfectly fine.  
I even contacted Uber about this but they were no help at all.  Twice they just repeated verbatim the rating policy and the third time they still said they couldn’t help me.

Only difference is, I did it in my house instead of the car, since I was going to start from home and wait for my first ride..

			I had done some comparisons between Lyft and Uber last year and

			get my daily number ($230) in a predictable number of hours, just
			that it was an extra hour with Lyft, and this was primarily due to
			quests, consecutive rides, and surges which were less or non-
			existent on Lyft.  After Christmas, things changed. There's the
			normal seasonal reduction in rides that has been steadily
			improving. But in that period I had to run both Lyft and Uber to
			get enough pings to make my number, and in several cases it was
			closer to $150 for the same number of hours.  Currently in Boston,
			at least, things are very changeable. Obviously Lyft and Uber are
			duking it out for market share. One day will be mostly Lyft and no
			Uber, and then it will be mostly Uber and little Lyft, or 50/50.
			Uber's quests totally suck now -- I can barely get 30 rides in the
			three or four days the quests last, and then I get a whopping $10
			or some shit. Compared to last summer and fall when I was doing 70
			rides and getting $160, it's completely changed. Surges are rare.
			And the consecutive rides value is like $4 now, and they are
			impossible to get due to reduced overall volume (and because I have
			to split between Uber and Lyft) Meanwhile, Lyft is doing it for me
			much better overall. Still only one Challenge recently, but streaks

			pings is good. My point is that you should not assume that they

	Go to their Greenlight Hub (bring in any supporting medical

	their PR department wants is a story that reads: "Uber's AI

	not your fault. I understand AI helps with the cost of verification.
	But there should be a swift way to appeal the AI decision and ask

POST TITLE: Trying to get started
I’ve made it through the application process, but am having some hesitations about getting going due to the rating system. How likely do you think it is for someone new to flunk out due to poor ratings? I left my last job due to the high performance stress and was hoping to find some relief in picking my own hours, but now I’m feeling a bit of anxiety over not performing well enough in this line of work. To clarify I also have social anxiety disorder and that is another daily hurdle to cross/maintain, but I have been working through that issue for a long time now and know that exposure is ultimately the best way forward. I really want this to work out and be accessible work that I enjoy doing, but I keep overthinking the ratings. The last job I had that was interacting with the public was bagging groceries as a teenager and, shockingly, I didn’t really like the very vocal rejection I would get from making an easy mistake. So, to wrap this up, how harshly do people tend to rate you? I worry about how long I’ll be able to do this for and if I’ll have to put in a lot of effort aside from time management and minimal communication.

	comment score: 7 | u/PM_ME_YOUR_PROBLEMS5
	Honestly a couple times that I got rated poorly is because I stretch
	myself too thin and I realized that. I took two orders and didn’t
	check to see what the items were until it was too late to drop it. A
	lot of them were custom items such as Christmas candy Christmas toys
	etc. and it was two days before Christmas so I had to do a lot of
	service and it ran me behind on both orders. I think you will be fine
	if you start by taking one job at a time until you’re completely
	comfortable. I work in the cancer field as my full-time weekday job
	and I understand to an extent what it feels like to be under a lot of
	stress especially with the patients we deal with. So this job is so
	much easier. And if I ever feel like I’m getting overwhelmed then I
	just take myself off of the next one or two hour shifts and finish
	the shift and job that I’m currently on before I open myself back up
	to new orders.

	comment score: 6 | u/SidePone
	99% of members are very nice and understanding. Any time my rating
	has fallen it’s been after I let myself get too overloaded, so I’ve
	done things I wouldn’t normally do (like let communications slip or
	grab what seemed to be an obvious substitute without asking to avoid
	being late).  Try to avoid getting in the weeds:  When you accept a
	big order, take yourself off schedule the following hour. Don’t
	double up too much until you get into a good rhythm with the job.
	Give yourself extra time at first. When doing back to back shops, be
	mindful of travel times and when you’d be getting back to the store
	for your next shops. Don’t be afraid to drop orders (you don’t need
	to give HQ an excuse, just “I need to drop order #...”). Better to
	drop the order then to get a late mark or get a bad rating.  So, the
	best you can do to get a good rating in my experience: Don’t
	substitute without asking (unless it’s a use best judgement). Send
	pictures of substitution options. Throw target or shipt under the bus
	(“sorry for all these subs! Targets not well stocked today.”) Send
	pictures of empty shelves to prove you’re not just being lazy, the
	store is just picked over. Pick good products (don’t grab the box
	that’s busted up and if it’s the only one left, send a picture and
	ask if the members okay with it). Good communication is a balance
	between keeping the member informed and giving them options for
	substitutions while also not being annoying.  A lot of people say
	being within the first half hour of delivery time is key but I’ve not
	found that at all as long as you’re communicating time frames with
	the customer. Good luck! You’ve got this! 😊

	Most of my ratings are good. Go slow to get started, avoid doubles
	and you’ll be fine. Don’t be afraid to drop an order if you are
	feeling stressed - AR is the least important stat. Give yourself
	plenty of time for each order and plan to deliver in the beginning of
	the hour (that way if something goes wrong you have time to fix it).
	Finally - communication. Intro text, sub texts, heading to checkout,
	ETA. All help with maintaining good orders.  And know that it’s
	unrealistic to expect to maintain a perfect five at all times - some
	people are just cranky or think a four is a good rating.  Good luck!

	comment score: 3 | u/mangoman39
	A lot of people like to pretend that there is an army of members out

	management skills, are willing to take the time to learn, and have
	the will power not to rush into it, you will be just fine.

	I struggle with social anxiety a bit as well. I hate social
	interactions and get very flustered when speaking to people. 95% of
	this job is communicating via text which helps a lot. I can stay
	super casual and calm while texting people. Just do t text members
	like you text friends with a ton of abbreviations, emoji and spelling
	errors. Slow down and text in complete sentences. Not super formal,
	though. You'll find your voice and the right balance soon enough. And
	most customers are nice and excited when you show up. Let a bad
	rating go and realize a couple of 5* ratings will counter a 4* in no
	time.

	comment score: 2 | u/nikki_11580
	Looking at this sub, it’s easy to see why someone would be so worried
	about ratings. But in all honesty, most of the customers are nice. If
	you don’t overload yourself and communicate then it’s easy to get 5s.
	If you’re worried about putting yourself on the schedule, just grab a
	small order off metro. I will say that once you put yourself on the
	schedule, shipt will send you orders even if you already have an
	order claimed for a certain hour. It can get overwhelming. So if you
	claim an order for a certain hour, take yourself off the schedule for
	that hour.

POST TITLE: OWYA, told not to call in?
Usually when I’m going to a diner-type place that I know doesn’t have a tablet, I’ll call in the order before or during my drive to the store. I did this yesterday to a local place because the day before was my first time there and I had a 15+ minute wait with no room to sit down. Due to my chronic pain and being in hot weather that makes me miserable, I didn’t want to repeat that experience. 
Only, when I get there, the cashier noticed my DD card and told me I’m not supposed to be calling in orders to them. They’ve had “Dashers” (not sure how they knew they were 3rd party orders) place $50+ orders and never come get them. 
Knowing I personally wouldn’t abandon an order after calling it in, should I keep doing it? Or stop for this place?

If you had an underlining medical condition but did not test postive or were not directly exposed you were not getting paid. Ive worked the last 14 days stright, 9 hours a day to afford my bills. Thank god I could just do UberEats instead of giving rides. Im still kind of scared. Im so tired. Im so happy I get to take a day off tommrow. I just wanna say somthing. Speaking for full time drivers. 
No one can afford to not pay rent. No one can afford the late fees. We dont have medical insurance. We dont have sick pay or PTO. I get it we are "independent contractors" but you deactivate and deny people sick pay that you offered in the first place? How if someone tells you they have a serious underling medical condition could you do that?  DEACTIVATE THEM AND NOT PAY THEM. Your day of reckoning will come Uber and Lyft. And when the lawsuits start flaying after all the dusts has settled you will be begging to pay that sick pay and if drivers start dying on your platform because you refused to pay them and they kept driving.... be ready to see how fast a judge throws out that arbitration agreement. You will be begging to pay what you promised once those settlement numbers pop up.

	magical payday.  I only hope that both companies are FORCED to stop
	mis-classifying drivers.  However, at BEST, we can only go back two
	years for arrears.  The most they can be forced to pay is double the
	pay we should have gotten plus attorney fees.  There is no magical
	million dollar payouts to each driver or anything.   >Your day of

POST TITLE: Disabled driver needs an assistant. Will Uber allow this?
I want to become an Uber driver to make a little extra money to help cover the bills. However, I have one problem. I'm disabled. I can drive without issue but I would not be able to help people in and out of the car, assist with their bags at the airport or any other physical needs. If I got sent to another disabled person's home, I definitely would not be able to put their wheelchair in my trunk, since, well my own chair is there.
I can solve most of this problem by bringing my husband with me. He would be dressed well, clean shaven etc.,  and treat any of our guests with dignity and respect. He would help with bags. He would be quiet and offer whichever seat the rider preferred. He would also be silent through out the ride unless the guest wished to talk to him. He would do the driving himself except he's partially blind.
So my question is, would Uber allow this? I've heard of drivers getting fired for having other people in the car. But this is kind of a delicate situation. 
Advice? Thoughts?

	Uber does not allow drivers to have another person in the car who is
	not a paying rider. The car has to be able to pick up the max number
	of riders. An option would be to indicate that you are disabled in
	your profile. The riders can read this. However there are a number of
	riders who do not know of the profile. As far as assisting with
	luggage, I would assume tha most riders would understand. There are a
	number of able bodied drivers who do not assist with luggage.

POST TITLE: 104 deliveries, 4.41 rating. How to improve?
My rating was 4.0 at 32 deliveries and had steadily climbed up to 4.56 over the following 69 deliveries. Made 5 deliveries last night and my rating has suddenly dipped to 4.41. It says this is a Medium rating. What is considered a sufficient rating? At what point will they start holding me accountable for my ratings, now that I have surpassed 100 deliveries? Will I receive any warning before deactivation?
I don't even know which customers rated me poorly which makes it difficult to improve as a Dasher. The only thing I can think of is a box of food last night was leaking some kind of shrimp sauce that I didn't notice until I got to the destination. What are some ways I can continue to improve my rating? I really like this job and want to make it work however possible.
Thanks in advance for any support and tips. Have an anxiety disorder which makes me worry every time my rating goes down.

	comment score: 5 | u/DDbabe2020
	Believe 4.7 and above is good. I've heard different people say below
	4.2 is deactivation and I've heard before 4.5 also. Def I'd say

	I bought from Doordash last night. For the first time, they asked for

		comment score: 2 | u/DCowboysCR
		I’ve taken over 2,200 deliveries as a Dasher and ordered over 70
		times as a customer in the last couple years. On the iOS version
		it’s always had only 2 ratings: “food” and “delivery”. The problem
		is the delivery rating does not specify that the rating is
		specifically for the driver nothing else.  Many times customers will
		rate on the total delivery experience which factors in things the
		driver has no control over. You must educate your customer that the
		rating only pertains to you individually for delivery.

POST TITLE: Drivers with Disabilities
Hi /s/uber,
I'm planning to cut back to part-time & freelance for my primary job, & I was considering driving for Uber as an occasional change of pace - I enjoy driving, & am a bit of a social creature, so it seems like a cool thing to pick up for a day or two on slow weeks. 
I use a wheelchair due to a Spinal Cord Injury 18 years ago. I'm fully licensed, have professionally-engineered hand controls, & once I'm in my car I have no barriers to driving safely. Essentially, the only way to tell I have a disability is from seeing my hands operating the hand controls. I meet all requirements (newer car, background check, etc). 
By law & de facto, my disability does not impact on my ability to drive so long as my license conditions are met (automatic transition & modified vehicle). The only thing I can foresee that I'm unable to do is anything requiring the driver to be outside the vehicle (helping with luggage, etc).
 
* Is there anything which asserts that Uber drivers *must* be able to leave the vehicle?
* Is it required that a driver be able & willing to help with luggage etc?
* Can you think of any reason why I'd be less able to perform the inherent duties of the job?
* Are there any drivers that you know of in a similar situation?
* `NEW` My chair takes up most of the boot of my car. Would I be required to make that space available to rides for their luggage?
* `NEW` Are drivers able to advertise (in platform) as "no luggage" or similar?

	I don't think helping toss someone's 50lb suitcase in the trunk is a
	requirement. I know drivers that don't help people. They pull up, see
	they have luggage, and just pop the trunk from the driver's seat.
	Even though we get shit wages, and it more than likely won't lead to
	a tip, I help every single time because people are lazy and will just
	drag their bags across my bumper and damage it. Don't let the fear of
	tossing bags deter you. I've done 150 trips, and maybe only 10 had
	luggage.

	You can drive for Uber Riders might get pissy because you don't help
	with luggage.  You should request an *accommodation* from Uber
	similar to the one they have for hard of hearing.  Note that I did
	that four months ago and it has had no effect. I'm disabled, not as
	severely as you, and do not assist with luggage.  I know for a fact
	it's led to poor ratings on occasion, and I just don't care.

	I don't know... was your customized car free? If so, and if you can
	keep replacing it for free every 3 years or so, uber might be a great
	idea for you. As far as having to get out of your car... there are
	times but it's rare. Like cleaning puke off the side of your
	doors/windows, collecting garbage and cleaning spilled drinks/puke
	from the back seat, etc. Exiting your vehicle with keys in hand for
	safety reasons will not be an option for you. As far as luggage,
	you'll just have to cancel. Too many cancels and uber bots will start
	to give you grief and possibly deactivate you. Of course, you can
	explain your situation to uber support when this happens and they
	might give you a pass. They would probably jump at the chance to
	plaster your story in an ad or news article. Your first call needs to
	be to your insurance company and check with them how driving for uber
	will affect your coverage and rates.

	Just as Uber says a driver may not refuse a passenger based on a
	disability, they themselves may not refuse you just because of your
	disability.  If you meet all the requirements, you can drive for
	them.

	Would also depend on how the TNC's are regulated in your area.  Some
	regulations say a driver must be able to at least fold up a wheel
	chair and put in the trunk for a passenger.  THis is if they are
	under city or state regulation that say they cannot refuse
	handicapped passengers.   If you however have a van they could also
	roll right in then that would be great for them.  But if they would
	have to transfer into a standard seat then someone would have to stow
	the chair.   Although I would think once they saw you are also in a
	chair I do not think anyone would complain if you ad to find them
	another ride. No drivers are not able to advertise what they or their
	cars cannot handle.  WOuld be a good idea especially for people with
	small trunks.  BUt for now the TNC assume everyone has 4 seats and a
	standard size empty trunk for the passengers to use. Give it a try,
	all they can say is no or you get deactivated, but do not quit your
	day job for this racket.

	I’m in Chicago. I’ve been able to do this as a “full time” job after
	being let go a few months. I do mostly furniture assembly and moving
	help as I have a truck. So far this month I’m at $1100 on 25 hrs
	invoiced. The least amount I’ve made in a month was $2000 and it
	wasn’t really a full month. Keep in mind I set my availability 7days
	a week 8am-12am unless I have an appointment or something planned.
	Cleaning is a pretty popular category. I used to offer it at like
	$34/hr($40/hr total for the customer) but that was much higher than
	TRs recommended rate cause I had no jobs in it yet. They want you to
	start around $16-17/hr and work your way up. I kept it higher cause I
	didn’t really want to do it but if someone was willing to pay that
	much I would. I was hired only once. You probably won’t get hired in
	those other categories you mentioned. I’ve only had like 2 jobs in
	the data entry, personal assistant type stuff. It’s also important to
	consider, how you set your work area. My work area is set from Rogers
	Park to the South Loop and goes as far west as Pulaski.  Factor in
	your travel time into the rate cause you cannot invoice for it. It’s
	not worth it to travel an hour on the L and back for an hour job if
	you only make $20.  If you are looking up profiles in our area, you
	can probably find me. DM if you want my name to look up my profile
	for any questions.

POST TITLE: Does Door dash really take ratings serious?
So, I've been doing DD for two days and even though I'm liking the money and the location (I walk to my car and stat delivering as soon as I get out of my apartment complex), I've already had an issue with the app screwing up two hours worth of orders, I have a one start rating for no reason (I've only done eight deliveries and they were all on time), and I hate the bombardment of orders while you're in the middle of an order.  Anyway, I'm rather pissed about this rating thing, iunno why it could be low.  I don't look into their bags and physically check, maybe missing items? I go through the items with the merchant.  Cold food?  The bag suck for temp control and I'm in Chicago where its 30 degees, so that doesn't help.  Maybe I look high or smell like weed? I have to smoke for my disorder so I can't help anything there.  Do you guys have any tips for getting good ratings, like from personal experience? Also, does anyone know of any containers that hold heat better than that bag?   Does anyone have bad ratings and has anyone actually gotten deactivated?
If you already couldn't tell, I kind of have to use this job for everything its worth so yeah, I need it.  My disability makes it the only thing I can do reasonably well without triggering my symptoms.

	My best advice is to- gain happiness from your toil. As long as
	you're enjoying it keep doing it. This job can be very enjoyable when
	the apps working, but the app has issues and it's not your fault when
	it messes up, keep that in mind if you ever get in a jam like the
	restaurant already had the food delivered hours ago or the phone
	won't stop ringing or you're not getting any orders for hours. You
	can use a spare ice chest for temperature control. It's always nice
	talking to the people its why i like the job. after a few hours it's
	highly advisable to stop and take a little food break because driving
	requires quite a bit of focus and your brain needs yummy food! Just
	be timely and get forks and napkins, that's all you can really do to
	get a high rating. I got a one star when the App assigned me two
	orders at once... let's just say the burger was cold and the other
	person's ice cream was melted. It stressed me out, but after seeing
	so many issues I realize there's nothing I can do but enjoy the song
	on the stereo while I drive within the laws limits and that's about
	it. It's the food industry at worse someone isn't going to get there
	Happy Meal, if you drop a burger it it's okay that's why I like the
	food industry at worst you can cause 20 bucks in damage working on
	cars is stressful do you leave one bolt loose you could cost someone
	their life you drop a nut down the fucking intake you cost $5,000.
	It's good to remember to have the smile on and a fuck it attitude
	it's crucial with this app

So I do instacart for many reasons, but the main reason still stands at number one. lifelong have health issues which have caused my work life to be a great one, however one which always leaves me going on disability. Shopping for Instacart changed that to a high degree and it’s the only job I can imagine doing. Even this is hard on my agoraphobia, panic attacks, new heart health, etc issues.....but I’m worried af. Just heard, from an ACME employee whom I trust and is awesome, that Instacart and ACME are ending their contract within about 2-3 months because ACME is starting their own delivery. Old news?

POST TITLE: Newb Concerns Re: Mild Physical Disability & Heavy Bulk Orders...
Hey guys, i'm a new FSS and i start next Thursday so i've been lurking this sub for tips, advice, Shopper's general experiences with IC. So far i've found a ton of helpful information, but the one thing i've been (maybe needlessly) stressing about are the numerous horror stories i've read here about huge bulk orders of heavy beverage cases, bags of ice, pet food, etc. needing to be lugged up 8 flights of stairs and the like. i know how naive this makes me sound, but it's just one of those things i never would have thought of in a million years because i don't shop like that for my household and in all my years in retail i rarely, if ever, saw orders like that come through my lines. i understand now that's exactly why customers use IC to shop for those things, so they can have someone else do the heavy lifting for them.
   
i guess what i'm getting at is, how common are orders like those? i realize there are a huge number of factors in play here that make it hard to give even a rough estimate, but in YOUR experience, how many/how often have you had to deal with heavy bulk orders like that? once a day, once a week? i have chronic back problems due to a congenital deformation in my spine (not visibly noticeable yet, but i'll have a Dowager's hump you could cross the Sahara on by the time i'm 45...) and countless work-related injuries throughout my life. i do plan on getting a collapsable handcart and crates as i've seen suggested in this sub, which will no doubt help me out a great deal. the thing is, i know there are going to be days every once in a while when my back pain will make it physically impossible for me to complete an order like that and i'm going to have no choice but to decline the order. i'm just afraid of racking up like, 5 RIs in a month and getting booted right away. other than that, IC seems like a very good fit for my needs and lifestyle so i'm really hoping it's not a case of "maybe it's just not the right job for me." i will also have at least 1-2 other platforms like Postmates to fall back on in case i'm unable to work as many IC hours as i'd like. 
 
whew, sorry for the long winded post, guess i just have some n00b jitters to work off. but thanks for taking the time to read if you made it to the end, and any other tips or suggestions for a rookie are welcome. thanks guys!

	comment score: 2 | u/IC_Shopper
	it depends but you will get them. for me i rarely see them now a days
	but there was a point where it was common to see them once a week at
	least. for instance last week there was one day where everyone of my
	orders had at least one heavy item such as a 20 pound bag of rice or
	petfood, 10-20 pound bag of ice, or two cases of water.  if your in a
	zone that has DO expect to see them constantly as it is common to see
	everyone passing up 20 cases of water from costco and they send it to
	you to see if you'll be the idiot who takes it when no one else wants
	it. there was a point where customers would order more than one case
	of water and i would just grab one and tell the customer that was all
	they had just so i wouldn't have to do extra lifting. now a days i
	have a heavy dolly that folds side ways that makes it easy to haul 3
	cases of water with ease so i don't mind. so my suggestion is to
	either get a dolly to make things easier for you or to limit the
	heavy items to one per item or don't work on the platform.

	Like you said, there are a lot of variables. I've been with Instacart
	since April, have done countless orders, and have *never* had one of
	those "99 cases of x" orders that some people seem to get. It
	probably depends a lot on what kind of zone you're in. I mostly work
	in a mid-sized suburban area, which I imagine is a lot easier than
	working in a big city. Although I've never had personal experience
	with them, if I were to guess, I'd say that a lot of those crazy huge
	orders are often placed by businesses. In my whole time working for
	Instacart, I've only ever shopped for a business on two occasions -
	and both times, I was in larger cities than the ones that I typically
	work in. So if you have the option of working in more suburban areas
	(and I know that not everyone does), then you might want to consider
	doing so. You might also be able to avoid lots of bulk orders, if you
	avoid shopping at Costco. Before you're able to receive any Costco
	orders, you have to actually sign up for a store membership through
	Instacart - which personally, I've never done. There are pros and

		once i get the hang of things i might try the city, but we'll see...
		good to know about Costco, i figured i'd have to take what i got
		unless i wanted an RI. i even thought about going out there to get
		the membership set up before i even started my first shift so i
		wouldn't have to waste time signing up when the first order came in,
		lol... so in that case i might hold off. AFAIK there's only 1 Costo
		and 1 BJs in the area and neither of them are in my home zone, but
		that's something i'm still unsure if, if you ever get sent to a
		store that's outside the zone you're working that day? anyway,
		thanks for the info!

POST TITLE: Banned from Upwork after called names for my disability
I'm writing because I really need some help or advice.
I have type 1 bipolar disorder and I'm a drug and alcohol addict of 20 years.  I've been living in sobriety / recovery for the last 15 months and the only job I've been able to hold down is as a freelancer on Upwork.
This week, I hired someone on Upwork to help me with some website work (for my mental health website where I help others) and the person I hired called me names when I asked for edits he didn't like.  I fired him.  Then he started taunting me by making comments about how he feels sorry for how bad my life is and my mental health.  So I said some rude things to him.
When you struggle with mood disorders like mine, it's really hard sometimes to keep cool when that happens.  I wasn't expecting to be taunted, and provoked like that and I responded poorly.  But I was provoked about my disability that I can’t control sometimes.
I said nothing racist, nothing discriminatory, but then I got an email from Upwork saying I did something racist or discriminatory and I was banned forever from Upwork. 
My response to him telling me I had a terrible life because of my disease was to tell him he lives in a third world country.  He later said a lot of things that didn’t make sense and I told him that his Upwork profile says he is fluent in English but that I can’t understand what he’s saying. 
I didn't handle it well, but I did NOT start this and I did NOT say anything racist as “Jast” in Upwork support claims.  
It's really hard making it in this world when you have to overcome mental illness and addiction and I really need a chance to have a second chance to feed my kids with this job on Upwork.

	Here you go.... This is from the explanation I got from Upwork about
	the ban.  This is a quote, which includes a direct quote from me
	within the message from the Upwork support person. “I have reviewed
	the conversation thoroughly and unfortunately, you mentioned "You’re
	the worst of all the cheap third world country web designers... you
	spend all your time arguing with people who fire your broke ass" and
	"Your life sucks. Stay poor kid." these are considered a direct
	racist/offensive remarks.” The “your life sucks” comment was my

	(which he knows of because it’s part of the content of the site he
	was designing).  Like I’ve said before.  I’m not proud of the

POST TITLE: Starting Lyft tomorrow and I have a couple questions for drivers with disabilities
Hey all! So, I have a couple questions that I can't really find answers to anywhere online:
1. I have an anxiety disorder that makes driving sometimes a little difficult for me, but it's substantially improved by using audio navigation through Google Maps. Are Lyft drivers allowed to put on audio navigation during drives? Is it a party foul that will land me with bad reviews?
2. I have Intraocular melanoma (eye cancer) that makes me very light sensitive and I need to wear sunglasses pretty much every time I'm outside. When I thought about it, I don't remember ever having a Lyft driver that wore sunglasses. Is this considered rude or am I overthinking?
Thanks for any responses!

	I find that driving for Lyft really helps my anxiety. I also drive

	And I will usually talk to partners about the route I am taking. The
	audio helps facilitate a dialogue with passengers about that route so
	it's good for everyone. As a pax, I wish more drivers would have the
	audio on but I'm sure it depends on the market and roads. As a pax,
	sunglasses would not bother me. I do agree with other comments about
	driving at night but again, your results may vary depending on your

This morning I accepted a delivery to this lady that has a very steep staircase and she always orders a huge case of water to which I separated the water in half and put them in nice freezer bag separate  hot / cold freezer bags. I called Postmates and let them know  why I did that. They called to let the customer know and told me the customer hit the roof. I told Postmates that I can't carry a case of water up 42 stairs. I offered the lady to keep my brand new bags too.
Postmates said i wasn't in trouble . I guess going off the do your best to get it to the doorstep rule applies .
I explained I had open heart surgery 10 years ago and my breast plate is wired shut but I am not to picked heavy stuff like a case of water up a full flight of stairs. To which the customer said I should not be working a PM and I need to be on disability. PM told me to just skip her next time.
