So I was officially diagnosed as Autistic last year, when I was 18. My councillor wasn't too surprised about this news and had suspected I had something undiagnosed.
The thing is, I've expressed concerns about my mental capabilities during the time I've been around them. (I've been seeing this org since I was 14), and wasn't until I was 17 they've decided to pursue a diagnosis of some kind.
I specifically talked about my lack of focus, frequent dissociation and struggles in academic environments and subjects. This wasn't just a off mention, I talked about it a lot during sessions, and talked to multiple people (teachers, school councillors, social workers).
I was wondering if my late diagnosis  could be due to the [discrimination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_in_medical_diagnosis), in that, I was not taken seriously or pushed away because I present as a woman and/or am a PoC. 
TL:DR ***despite expressing concerns throughout the years, I was only diagnosed last year. Was wondering if this could be due to gender of racial bias***
Thanks and apologises for any mistakes.","There is definitely a gender bias when it comes to the diagnosis of autism as well as ADD/ADHD in women and women-aligned people. A big part of it is that medical professionals look for symptoms that typically manifest in boys and men and do not recognise that these conditions manifest differently in women.   
Diagnosis is also harder for adults in general , since most stereotypical cases of autism and ADD/ADHD are diagnosed when one is very young.",120.0,1,1,1

Now I just feel like feminists are misandrists, not only them but some women too after hearing a lot of shit like ""men are shit!"" and ""men are trash"", double standards, and low appreciation for men in this society.
How do I deal with this? I genuinely mean it. I really don't want to fight misandry with misogyny but it just happens and I can't help it sometimes with hating women/feminists and thinking they are trash sometimes.
I know that change starts with me, but how do I do it? Anything to change my look on society?

I'm gonna be honest with you here, I'm not interested in being a feminist(That's not my thing, to be fair) I just wanted to put down my rage and anger toward women/feminists because I know that won't do me any good and just wanted to treat them equally without feeling bias while focusing on what I was browsing/doing before I was introduced to these subreddits.

I am a female manager in a male-dominated profession (my current team is all men). I feel respected and listened to at this particular job, but in general, I have experienced that in male-dominated environments (which includes the leadership strata at most places), your assessment is mostly true. Women are held to a very high standard and there is little tolerance for mediocrity. If you are a superstar, you will be respected. If you are not, you will be ignored (at best).
I suppose the way I have personally dealt with this is to try to make sure that I am so competent and effective that almost everyone ends up respecting me, and anyone who doesn't wouldn't dare say it out loud. I know this is not a very helpful answer.",62.0,1,1,1

I recently heard a pic say she can’t be racist when she was certainly saying some bigoted stuff regardless. She said racism is “scientifically defined” as power + prejudice - that confused me. 
Like, a poor white family in a rural trailer park doesn’t have more “power” than The Obama Family. 
How is this new definition helpful? Seems to just burn a lot of bridges.","the purpose of power + prejudice was to move discourse away from the idea of being racist as a personal failing, and instead focus on structural oppression and the material reality of minority groups. 
Basically liberal society largely seems to have conceived racism as 'being irrartionally mean', but for people with a materialist anti-racist perspective, that definition isn't productive or insightful and the lack of material, tangible progress for black people post-civil rights made it clear that there needed to be more focus on power dynamics and historical context to combat racism.

Mind-blowing as the theories are, there's always that uneasy feeling of doubt: What if the theories are all guessworks? How are their validity assessed? How are they used and how are they relevant to the real world? 
When he was Chairman of the Social Science Research Council in Britain, Andrew Schonfield wrote:
>""In the social sciences it is rarely possible to pose questions and provide answers in the manner of some of the natural sciences, and it is a refusal to recognize this that has often led us up the wrong path. It is the nature of most of our work that it tends to produce useful ideas and an increasingly firm factual base, rather than clear-cut answers to major policy questions. We must try to tease out the relationships which have a crucial effect on policy and, in doing so, provide not so much widely applicable generalizations as a sound, informed basis for decision-making and, at the same time, cut down the area of reliance on guesswork and prejudice."" (Schonfield, 1971).
I wholeheartedly agree with this quote, but can't seem to find the ""increasingly firm factual base"" for the theories that I'm interested in. For example, do we have any ways to verify Foucault's claims of how power works, or Judith Butler's claims of the existence of many genders, apart from just following the reasoning in their books? What are their contributions to practice-oriented research, apart from providing a possible interpretation of the social phenomena in question? Does policy-making ultimately rely on factual findings, rather than the theories?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

To begin, I work in the field of criminal justice and conduct research related to the intersection between crime and gender. There are a number of activists of every persuasion on social media who represent criminological research poorly.
To get a few assumptions out of the way:
I am a white man. As a result of this, I already:
(1) Listen to women and racial minorities when they speak.
(2) Do not invalidate the lived experiences of others, though I do often find that my own experiences with poverty, trauma, and mental, physical, and sexual abuse are invalidated on a regular basis.
(3) Do not involve myself in debates of racism online unless to reject racism or prejudice in conversations I have started myself, because my opinion is elsewise of little value and I don't know what it's like to be non-white.
(4) Do not respond to threads by women on women's issues in conflict with their perspective, because to do so is rarely productive, and I am well-informed from previous posts that this conduct that I have never engaged in to begin with is improper. I don't come into threads women start asserting my need to be empirically correct, I don't question the validity of their experiences. I generally just avoid engaging entirely unless to share in agreement.
With these out of the way, misinformation when promoted by anyone of any ideology has a direct impact on my field of study. It makes communicating criminological and crime truths more difficult and obfuscates the causes and consequences of numerous sociopolitical social structures, functions, forms, paradigms, and interactions. If I see activists propagating untrue information, what is the best course of action in countering such misinformation?","Representing just myself here, but I like it when the person I’m talking to shows a genuine interest in an area of research. If someone corrects me by saying “you know I actually saw a related study from blah that said the long term effects weren’t as dramatic as they originally appeared” then I feel like I’m talking to someone who actually cares.

Demographic Majority - The ethnic group that makes up over 51% of the region or state or country or jurisdiction's population. Generally the demographic majority forms the basic framework of the society when it comes to culture or economics or other areas. All nation-states are countries with a demographic majority.
Voluntary Minorities - These are ethnic minorities that willingly came to another country or area and went through an official immigration process. There are generally filters in place to both make sure the immigrant is a good fit for the country and only a certain type of person would be willing to leave their homeland and desire to become an ethnic minority somewhere else. Voluntary minorities are often model minorities and generally exhibit the [immigrant paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_paradox) where first generation immigrants outperform the native born population when it comes to health, education, low crime, etc.
Involuntary Minorities - These are ethnic minorities that were forced to become part of the country they currently inhabit. This could either be due to the fact that they were militarily conquered, they were forcefully migrated, or they were enslaved and brought to the nation. Involuntary minorities tend to be opposed to the dominant culture due to past resentment and stigmatization of their native culture and language/dialect and behaviors. This leads to involuntary minorities having far lower income and educational attainment than other groups. In the USA, involuntary minorities who are seen as being too assimilated into the dominant ethnicity are disparaged as ""acting White"". A good example of an involuntary minority would be Aboriginal Australians.
Refugees - Refugees are people who come to a country not because they wanted to join the nation-state but because they had to leave their home nation for safety. This could be either be due to active warfare and violence in their country or origin or religious, ethnic, or economic persecution. Refugees generally try to seek asylum in the nearest safe country that will take them. Refugees often return to their country of origin if it becomes safe again. If refugees do not decide to return to their country of origin, they generally exist as a non-integrated underclass. A good example of a refugee group would be Syrians in Turkey.
Elite (or Dominant) Minorities - These are ethnic groups that have massive amounts of political, socioeconomic, and cultural control in a country despite the fact that they are a minority. A classic example are White South Africans during the apartheid days. Elite minorities are extremely over-represented and almost exclusively reside in the upper echelons of society. Dominant minorities should be not confused with model minorities.
Model Minorities - A model minority ethnic group is an ethnicity that is perceived as being more educationally or occupationally or behaviorally successful than the typical person in the country. A good example of model minorities would be Indian Americans in the USA. The difference between an model minority and a dominant minority is that the demographic majority still has most of the political and economic control in a society with model minorities, but that is not the case with dominant or elite minorities. A model minority might also still face structural or institutional prejudice and discrimination in their country despite their socioeconomic success while a dominant minority cannot face institutional racism because they control the institutions.
Underclass Minorities - Just like how model minorities are more successful than the socioeconomic average of a country, underclass minorities are less successful than the socioeconomic average of a country. This could be due to a variety of factors.
Subservient Majority - This is the inverse of a dominant minority. This is a demographic majority that does not have representative political and economic influence in their country due to being ruled by a dominant minority.

There are a lot of studies comparing the statistical outcomes and opinions and behaviors of African-Americans compared to Asian-Americans or Mexican-Americans or White-Americans  but I do not think that is a good comparison due to the vastly different history African-Americans have to those other groups. I think African-Americans would be most comparable other involuntary minorities within the USA like Native Americans and Native Hawaiians and Native Alaskans and Puerto Ricans and Samoans and Guamanians, etc.

are there any research or thesis papers that covers the assimilation or segregation of various involuntary minorities or even just indigenous groups in several countries like Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Russia for instance?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

- ""I wouldn't rape you, because you're too ugly.""
- ""You should shave.""
- ""Can I piss in your mouth?""
- ""Do you shave down there?""

And that people will commonly do things that are wrong as long as they are very sure they won't get caught.

But in a shame culture, people won't feel any guilt for cheating at all, as long as they're careful. Correct me if I'm wrong!
To my Western mind, it seems to me that guilt cultures are more sincere, more true, and that shame cultures are shallow, caring only about appearances.  But this is probably cultural bias!

So far, they’ve been totally accepting of me and my feminist beliefs and agree with me for the most part. However, there is one member of the friend group whose views I find problematic.
He hates nearly all female-centred media (Ocean’s Eight, Ghostbusters, the new Doctor Who are examples he’s mentioned.) However, he states his reasoning for not liking these media are the writing, the actors etc. He says that none of the actors are compelling and they are dull. His latest critique is with the new Captain Marvel. He took issue with Brie Larson’s comments about white males and stated that she doesn’t embody the role (he hasn’t seen the movie yet.) He says her attitude to the movie is wrong and he called her dull and monotone. He’s made me feel bad for liking these forms of media. He sends me images of Doctor Who’s low score on Rotten Tomatos and he’s even hacked Rotten Tomatos to make Captain Marvel look like it got a low audience score in order to trick me into thinking it was bad.
I know that these issues are minor compared to other major issues concerning gender equality. Even my friends say that he’s got a bias against female leads. They’ve tried before to change his mind. I have no problem with people not liking these movies. For ages, I thought that he just disliked those movies because he just thought they were bad. But now that I notice the pattern in female-centric movies, it makes me feel kind of uncomfortable and insecure in the group. Perhaps I’m being overly sensitive.
I know I shouldn’t make it such a big deal. I’m not saying that he’s a sexist, but I definitely think that he might have an unconscious bias against women. The issue is that I really like my friends and they’ve helped me through some tough times. I’m afraid of bringing it up because I don’t want to distinguish my status any further as the only girl in the group. I don’t want to feel like the other. Hanging out with this guy is kind of part of the deal with this group of friends, so what should I do?","I've been in similar situations before with friends, the thing that's helped me work through it is to stop trying to discuss the actual issue causing the disagreement, and to instead talk with them about the way that the issue made me feel. So for example, I have a friend who used to make a lot of homophobic jokes and it made me very uncomfortable, anytime I tried to tell her that the things she was saying were homophobic I'd be met with things like ""I don't really see how it's homophobic though,"" ""Who cares if it's homophobic, it's still funny,"" or ""Yeah but clearly *I'm* not homophobic, I'm friends with you and you're gay,"" trying to argue about the topic itself was unproductive and only escalated things; what helped was to not argue about homophobia or the joke itself, but to just explain how the jokes made me feel, after I told her that those sorts of jokes made me uncomfortable and reminded me of other hurtful things I'd heard in the past and that it was difficult to hear those things from a friend, she was able to start understanding my side of things better and stopped making homophobic jokes (almost overnight tbh.)

Sometimes it's just not possible to get someone to agree with you on an issue, especially if it's something they're set in their ways about, but if you can make that issue more personal to them by talking about how the issue is important to you and how it makes you feel, you can help them open up their mind a bit more to change. Maybe instead of talking to him about whether or not he's being sexist, just try telling him that the way he talks sometimes makes you feel uncomfortable and insecure; if he values you as a friend then he should care about whether or not you're comfortable and he might make a bit more of an effort to change, and if he doesn't seem to care about your comfort then he's probably not much of a friend and nothing of value will be lost if you have to stop talking with him lol.",26.0,1,1,1

I have noticed a trend in research articles for researchers to just accept what participants say, as they say it. This is not to say that all people are lying, but some might even be lying to themselves perhaps. 
Outside of research as far as I can tell, there is a narrative in middle-class circles and the upwardly socially mobile of denigrating the working-classes as deserving their ""lower"" place due to them *being* lower, having less merit- the meritocratic narrative plus chauvinism we might call it. Conversely, working-class people often subscribe to a narrative of resentment in which middle-class people are put down as ""snobs"" and ""toffs"", which they might also often believe but also probably covers feelings of resentment, a kind of Freudian defense mechanism. 
While these narratives seem to have some research about them, it seems that the effect of these beliefs and how they might influence the performance of research participants in interviews doesn't seem to have been discussed much- or at least, I'm struggling to find anything about it. I'm an independent scholar currently so rarely have proper access to journals and decent library resources or guides that can help me improve my searches. 
I hypothesize that some interviewees may hide feelings of resentment, or superiority, from interviewers due to wanting to please them and enjoying the attention of being part of social research. For example, in some research about social mobility where participants claim that ""moving up in the world"" ""hasn't changed them"", that although they have been upwardly socially mobile, they retain their original social identity. I think it's possible that some of these interviewees may downplay how they have changed and when discussing why they think they have moved up in the world, narratives about hard work may hide deeper feelings of superiority. Similarly, would working-class participants be less willing to be so brazen as to call middle-class people ""toffs"" and decry social mobility as bullshit, when it is very likely that the interviewer would be middle-class? How do biases such as ""just world bias"" effect people's reasoning about social mobility and the justness of theirs or others social position? Is there much research into these things? 
Sorry if this isn't a very clear question, it came to me while doing other research.","So my background is sociolinguistics/linguistic anthropology, but because it intersects with economies of class and hegemony, especially in terms of narrative and communication, there are a couple I can think of off the top of my head that deal with class perpetuation and interview/interviewee dissonance.

I know it's tough not having access to university resources, so if you can't track down these individual articles, any author you particularly resonate with has probably written a book on the subject, especially the bigger names. They might be easier to find. These fields haven't always been very self-reflexive about the effect of the Observer Paradox, but I think the literature is moving in a direction that tries to look at these narratives from several different perspectives to get a more nuanced understanding of meaning-making and language use coupled with ideas about social value and social mobility.

This book had a flashy style like all the books for kids, with lots of graphics and images among the activities. For the school i get it, you get 30 or even 40 kids in a tight room, you could use some sort of visual catch to make the kids pay attention to the book and it's more didactic.
What leads me to ask this question is the following:
Some days ago i was helping my cousin who's a high school student with her homework, and i realized that she uses the same style of schoolbooks that i used, obviously the level of the content is something else, much higher than a school book... but nonetheless the books all had a very basic style, with stylized graphics and images just like the school-level books. 
It bothers me because i feel like while the books touch on the subjects, it has no depth on the content that the student is reading.
In example, i was explaining the laws of newton to my cousin and used some examples from recreative physics, a book from a 1913's Russian author that touches on physics without calculations and all of that. One story was about what would happen if the earth was to suddenly stop and the destructive winds and whatever. 
All this write up comes to this: I've talked to lots of people and they all agree that new books have less ""value"" than old books, (unless it's university-level text but even in some cases with hard science there's basically no change bethween a 1970's edition and a 2018 edition) but i'm no one to claim that.
Whenever i say that ""old"" books carry more content or that they are worse/better, maybe that's just how i look from my scope at this point in life. It's a easy to me to say that this or that is better or worse but it's the kids or the younger generation that take this content in their journey in education. Maybe everyone that i've talked to says that they agree with me because they romanticize their childhood and how they lived it.  
My guess is that those books are edited by people that are more intelligent than me, and they studied pedagogy and know what they are doing, but sometimes what happens behind the courtain isn't exactly what it looks like at first. In example, university textbooks that are expensive for no reason than because they are required. 
The reason why i can't shake this feeling is because something is actually changing about education in ways that i cannot percieve but hold on for a moment, i'd rather ask here and see if anyone can give me an answer instead of carrying on with an opinion that may be wrong as the result of a bias of mine. 
So to sum it up, is there any evidence that changing the way that the content is delivered to the student speaking strictly about high school level textbooks leads to more engagement or a better understanding of the subject by the students?",,,1,1,1

Hi! This is my first post and sorry if similar topics have been answered before - I opted for a new post so I can capture the details. I'm really just wondering on what people think about this since it has really stuck with me and I've been reflecting a lot as a result:
**Context**  
Before the pandemic, I was seeing a girl I met at University (a few months and it didn't work out but it ended amicably). One of the days we were hanging out at my place with three of my housemates (female) and they frequently commented on things like the male character in a film (The Quiet Place - I recommend it, btw!) being useless and stupid because he's a man, and me not understanding why he's useless because I'm also man, etc. Since this is a Reddit post, I don't want to paint them in a bad light: I could tell they didn't mean anything negative by it and it seemed like they were kind of having a good time and bouncing off each other. Similar things happened frequently with this girl during the time we were seeing each other, but to the point.
Later that night, she asked what was bothering me since she could tell something was on my mind (I was taking longer than usual to fall asleep). I explained that I felt a bit weird and didn't really like when she/my housemates would often make negative remarks about me or my other housemate (the other guy in the house) and attribute when we messed up (less jokey examples) to being male. We had a messy argument about it which we resolved over the course of a few hours. The next morning I felt uncomfortable about it so we talked some more and were both put at ease.
**My Questions**  
What I'm asking about are the things she said that really stuck with me:
I said (approx) that I can only sympathize with the effects of sexism against women (she said that I didn't understand because I'm a man) but that I'm only responsible for myself / not how other men act and have acted in the past.  
She said (approx) that I need to take responsibility and that I don't get to complain about those kinds of comments since the oppression of women now (and historically) is so much worse.
I said something like how I would completely accept something like that if it were because of something I was responsible for and could appreciate the motivation but that it didn't make sense to me as to why they should be directed at me if I try my best to be better (and would call myself a feminist / act against sexism). She said that it might not be rational but that I should just trust that she knows that it's the case and that I was being a 'not-all-men bitch'.
Obviously I am writing this and it's reliant on my memory but I've done my best to give a fair account of what actually happened rather than being butt-hurt because she called me a bitch, lol.
Apologies that this is a long ping-pong of a post but I figured that asking here might be a good idea since maybe this has flagged up something in myself (like an implicit bias or way of thinking) that I need to identify and work on. **My questions are essentially just whether this way of thinking is something I should try to avoid (even if it doesn't make sense to me) or that my behavior is the kind of thing that contributes to sexism and works against feminist progress.**
Thanks!","I think you’re doing your due diligence just fine by acknowledging historical oppression and understanding the role it plays in this situation

This /r/askscience post is filled with many seemingly convincing arguments claiming that the police bias against Black Americans is overstated. Could someone authoritatively speak to these statistics?,"Drawn from this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gvc7k9/black_lives_matter/
>Source from the Department of Justice, look at table 12. The number of White violent offenders in 2018 was 2,669,900, White people were 62.3% of the population. The number of Black violent offenders was 1,155,670, Black people were 12% of the population. If Black people are that much overrepresented as violent offenders based on data from the survey of victims of crimes (data from the FBI also shows vast overrepresentation), then how is it racist for the police to be more likely to kill (justifiably or not) Black suspects?
Another post: 
>Police killings in the USA for 2018:
>White: 451 killed / 5.3M arrests = .008%
>Black: 229 killed / 2.1M arrests = .011%
>Hispanic: 165 killed / 1.2M arrests = .014%
>Black people are about 10 percent more likely to be killed during an arrest than the average. Perhaps that needs improvement, but it hardly constitutes a crisis in and of itself. The bigger problem is that black people are twice as likely to get arrested.
A third:
>Blacks are 2.5 times more likely to die from police because they disproportionately commit more violent crimes. FBI crime statistics from 2017 show that blacks committed 37.5% of violent crimes. Blacks make up 13.4% of the population, yet they are 2.79 times more likely to commit a violent crime. Hispanic/Latino individuals make up 18.3% of the population and commit 23.5% of violent crimes, so they are 1.28 times more likely to commit a violent crime.
**All the statistics in these comments appear to be accurate, but I believe I am missing something.** I have no doubt that the conditions of poverty and the legacies of systemic racism contribute to the contemporary behavior of some boys and men within the black community (media stereotypes, broken homes, poor education/nutrition, alienated families, low-income housing, etc.). **Nor do I believe that there is any genetic basis for any of these circumstances.** I'm sure it's all socialization. I'm just trying to get to the heart of police brutality against Black Americans specifically.","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Minus the discussions about what causes obesity and what we as a society can do to prevent and treat it, why does this particular topic always devolve into a hostile, bullying free-for-all? People that are overweight or obese are still deserving of some basic level of respect and dignity as human beings, but it's both baffling and disheartening to see so many people dismiss that aspect of the issue.
A few years ago, I had a major injury which prevented me from being as active as I normally am and as a result, I got fairly chubby. It was awful to experience first-hand that sort of bias that so many people have towards bigger bodies. As I recovered, I became more active again and eventually lost the weight, but I quickly noticed the way people were treating me better! My best friend also happens to be obese, and I know she's dealt with discrimination and harassment because of her size. I'm very close to her, so the thought of others treating her like that infuriates me.
I feel like some people just think that an overweight or obese person existing is 'GlOrIfYiNg ObEsItY' and take the opportunity to launch into a stream of reasons as to why that person is unhealthy and why they don't have to respect them because of their size.
I know that the origin of fatphobia comes from a deeply racist and misogynistic history. So why do so many feminists ignore, or contribute to the bullying when there is a bigger push for the movement to be intersectional?","Because being a feminist doesn't stop you being prejudice or bias in other ways - same way we have racism in the LGBTQ+ community, ableism in anti-racism communities, etc.

I conduct research in the field of criminal justice focusing on the intersection of gender and crime. My primary interests are cyberstalking/harassment and intimate partner violence, but I have a secondary interest in sexual assault issues.
I have a few side questions here and I want to ""make my case,"" as it were. I consider myself an ally to feminist causes and try to keep feminist perspectives in mind when researching for and writing papers, so I hope that this is taken in good faith, as I write it as such.
**My primary focus:**
Today, I was reading a thread on one of my social media pages where a woman I am friends with posted that if a woman is drunk, she cannot consent to sex, *period*. As one might expect, women in the comments agreed and one man objected. This appears to be the common response; that women mostly agree and men mostly disagree.
In my opinion, it's more complicated an issue than we sometimes give it credit. On the one hand, it's probably wise not to drink and have sex with anyone who isn't our already-committed partner. If someone is heavily intoxicated and we are not, we should never sleep with them or touch them in a sexual manner.
**On the other hand, how do we determine fault if both parties were drunk, and where do we set the bar? That is to say, is** ***any*** **alcohol at all too much to consent, or is there a certain threshold? How do we determine whether either party was too drunk to consent if there is a threshold without their blood alcohol levels? If a woman begins by accusing a man of sexual assault because she was drunk, but he was likewise drunk and decides to accuse her back, how do we determine who was telling the truth? (I'm not sure temporal order is a sound choice considering it would set a bad precedent to assume the person who accuses first is the most honest, as a victim may have many legitimate reasons for hesitating to report an assault or crime.)**
I'm not talking about obvious cases where we have a woman so drunk she's unconscious and a man who hasn't had a drink is engaging in sexual acts with her while she's passed out, I mean ambiguous circumstances. If we are going to use broad, sweeping language to determine whether women can consent when intoxicated, we have to determine whether it applies to every scenario or only a few. If it's only a few or certain situations that the argument applies to, the argument that *drunk at all* means *cannot consent* becomes untenable. I don't think I am taking the position out of context when the argument is proposed as follows (quoting one of the people in the thread from my social media):  
>Even if someone was drinking they're under the influence. You can not legally get tattooed if you've been drinking because you can not properly consent. Sex is the same way. You cannot consciously consent to it.
The argument I usually see tends to begin with saying ""if she is drunk she can't consent,"" and then moves to ""blackout drunk"" when further justification is required. However, not all drinking or being drunk is ""blackout drunk."" Shifting terms in post-justification seems to me to be a reckless way to treat a serious and already-complex issue.
I think this is a real question we have to answer, not one we can hand-wave away. Beyond women's victimization, which is important, the answer of whether men can consent when drunk if women can't determines whether men who are sexually assaulted by women or other men are legitimized as victims. There is also the issue of determining guilt in cases where all we have to go on are peoples' word, which is not as easy as simply taking one side at face value and concluding the other party guilty (though, this is often what we do).
Sex isn't something done to women by men or vice versa, it's a mutual act (men ""fuck"" and women ""get fucked"" is language of patriarchal conditioning, I'd argue). So, if both parties are drunk at the same time, what happens, then? It seems misogynistic to argue that men, when intoxicated, are possessed of far more self-control or cognitive function than women. Is mutual accusation that courts must sort out the safest route? Consent forms seem a little excessive in a hookup culture, but I have seen getting written consent proposed seriously and mockingly (if we take it seriously, the problem with that would be proving the form wasn't signed under duress or that the person was competent enough to sign at the time).
In any case, sober sex is definitely the safest course of action.
**Tangential focus:**
Regarding the phrase ""believe women,"" as someone who has been a victim of cyber harassment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, and false allegations at the hands of a former partner who was doing to me what she said I was doing to her, I think that we as a society need to reevaluate our interpretation of “believing victims” (regardless of gender). Specifically, the meaning of the phrase “believe.” My interpretation of believing victims is that we (the public, the justice system) should approach victims and perpetrators without preconceptions or prejudice. That is to say, putting aside preconceived notions and taking in and interpreting the facts of the case without judgment, in particular, while these facts are still coming out.
I have discussed this with colleagues at work and they've come to a similar consensus once we parse the language. Everyone certainly acknowledges that false accusations of sexual assault are far rarer than sexual assaults (which themselves are relatively rare as a subset of violent crime, generally, since crime and criminality themselves are relatively rare as compared to non-criminal conduct). What I am more concerned with here is how we determine guilt relative to mutual intoxication, or if we are developing a double standard in which men can consent when drunk and women cannot, thus rendering men rapists in cases where they could never be seen as legitimate victims themselves if the situation were reversed.
When I see someone accused of wrongdoing, I suspend judgment and wait for the facts. I don't assume the accuser or accused are telling the truth or lying, and I would hope that this should be the approach of law enforcement, as well. Meaning, they should listen to an accuser or victim without assuming things about her or him; for instance, they would listen without asking a woman why she was wearing a short skirt or why she was out drinking at 3 AM, or they would listen without asking a man why he didn't stop her if he didn't want it, and so forth.
That is, fundamentally, however, not “believing” victims in the sense of taking all their words as fact at face value. Yet, this appears frequently to be the way that this idea is interpreted. If I suspend judgment and observe facts without judgment as they come in, as I would hope police would when questioning an accuser and her or his accused, I feel pressured to side with the victim by default. But, I think that this does not capture the true spirit of ""believing victims"" that ought to be intended.
It seems to me that, while the justice system has a tendency to fail to handle many people who engage in sexual assault or domestic violence, the popular court of public opinion shoots firsts and asks questions later, and uses the above concept regarding belief wrongly. We too often fall on one extreme or the other in terms of 100% believing the victim or 100% victim-blaming, which I think happens just as often (men online immediately assuming the woman is lying, that is). Of course, the facts themselves need to be scrutinized fairly in the first place for this conversation to move forward in any meaningful way.
I hope this isn't too rambling. I am looking for a clearer feminist perspective on the varying variables of this topic, and have previously received some decent answers to questions here. I've not found reasonable satisfaction just from the people I know, and I don't think the #MeToo movement, which is still in its infancy, has reached the stage of addressing these nuances and issues yet, as it still fights for women's legitimization as victims at all (I don't fault it for that). Thank you!","Feminist perspectives, like criminal justice perspective, are in their infancy on the topic of drunk sex. College sex educators are just beginning to deviate from the binary of ""drunk = no consent.""
Psychologists and sexologists are working on questions like ""what does drunk consensual sex look like?"" "" How do we advise sexually active adults on incorporating alcohol in their sex lives?"" 
They're great questions. As for criminal justice, what you've said is correct. In most cases it's pretty clear if someone is committing sexual assault regardless of either person's intoxication levels: i.e: forcing oneself on a unconscious out drunk person is rape no matter how intoxicated either is. 
I think In more ambiguous ncases, more information besides alcohol level is going to determine if it is sexual assault, and who is the assaulter. Things like: Was someone violent? Did one person plan beforehand to get the other drunk and have sex with them? Was anyone coerced into sex?
In cases with similar levels of intoxication, all the other things that tend to indicate sexual assault, and help define consent are still hugely relevant. They might even be more significant than intoxication.

I only have an issue with the fact that when positive traits associated with masculinity, such as aggression when used to defend people and be a protector for people, doing a lot of hard physical work to provide for people you care about, and other positive masculine traits are presented, it is often argued that that shouldn't be associated with men or masculinity, as women can have these same traits. But when we're talking about toxic male behavior, that is considered to be only associated with toxic masculinity, as opposed to being associated with being an asshole. Which of course, anyone can be an asshole. Do you not see a bit of a bias there?

Women can be aggressive protective, or whatever else. Men can be nurturing and emotional.
Toxic Masculinity is more an idea that gender roles are so rigid and men are so heavily locked into one set ideal by society as to what a 'real man' looks like that they have to live to its extreme. So when you say being aggressive is a manly thing specifically, it means that men now have to live up to that idea.
The ideal would be to recognise gender roles are bullshit and stop using them. By letting people decide forthemselves what they want to be, without saying its 'not manly enough' (or of course the opposite, 'thats a mans job not a womans job').",13.0,1,1,1

Is this criteria commonly used in feminist circles? Is it the de-facto definition of racism or is it only situationally used?**  
Nope -it is contextually used to separate out simple racial prejudice from institutional/structural racism. It is an encapsulation of the idea that to be racist you need to institutionalise your prejudice, which requires structural power. It is more that racism *requires* power + prejudice , not that it is power + prejudice.   
**I am aware there is a term Colorism that applies when someone from a marginalized ethnicity is prejudiced. Is there some criteria of what type of institutional power someone needs to have for any bigoted actions to be considered racist? Could there be such a thing as Institutional Colorism or is that basically the new definition of Racism?**  
Colorism is a bit more complex - it refers to bigotry against people *within* the same ethnic group. This ethnic group does not have to be marginalised either. For example, India is a deeply colourist society, and even though the country is run by Indians (meaning we hold institutional power and aren't marginalised in the country), fairer-skinned Indians are treated better.   
People of colour can also be racist against other people of colour as long as there is a relative privilege. ""Model minorities"" such as Asians (east and south) fit this and can perpetuate anti-black racism.   
  
**One of the things that makes this hard for me to process is something like Trumps ban on trans people in the military. To me this meets the criteria of 'Power plus prejudice' but would be transphobic, not racist. How would this be described in feminist circles? In addition I have seen Sexism defined as 'Power plus prejudice' as well. Wouldn't it be better to make the definition of bigotry be 'Power plus prejudice' and leave racism/transphobia/sexism as bigoty based to the associated characteristic?**  
You're right - power + prejudice is not restricted just to racism, but all forms of systemic or structural discrimination. Again, the formula is just to lay bare the elements that are make something a systemic issue rather than defining the systemic issue itself.",9.0,1,1,1

Another part of this question. Is ""intelligence"" more of an abstract  concept? For example, does our society measure intelligence based on specific traits we find advantageous when there are other thought patterns that require high levels of brain activity that are deemed irrelevant to intelligence purely because they serve no purpose in THIS society?","Intelligence tests measure whatever they are meant to measure, specifically a construct psychometricians call intelligence. But *what* is intelligence? Citing [Urbina](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-intelligence/2B2F12DF09F4EF9D965E0DC523165293):
>Whether what intelligence tests measure is intelligence, on the other hand, is far more complicated as even a casual perusal of the field should reveal. Although many people assume that since intelligence tests exist, it must be possible for intelligence to be measured, **the fact is that intelligence is an abstraction, a construct we infer based on the data at our disposal and our own criteria**. As such, **it is not something everyone can agree on or quantify objectively**. Thus, **even among psychologists there is a wide variety of opinion about the meaning of intelligence**, depending on the perspective from which they approach the topic.
It is ultimately a label we apply to a set of skills we consider representative of [what we, in our culture, consider intelligence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693428/pdf/15347533.pdf). As argued by [Sternberg](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8206383_Culture_and_Intelligence):
>**Intelligence cannot be fully or even meaningfully understood outside its cultural context**. Work that seeks **to study intelligence acontextually risks the imposition of an investigator’s view of the world on the rest of the world**. Moreover, work on intelligence within a single culture **may fail to do justice to the range of skills and knowledge that may constitute intelligence broadly defined** and **risks drawing false and hasty generalizations.** 
In sum, an intelligence test built in one context can be (will be) in some way unfair to people from a different culture, as much as we make efforts to create 'culture-neutral' items. For example, not all human populations value abstract thinking as much as we do, giving much more importance to 'concrete' and practical skills and knowledge. At the moment I forget who wrote about the following, but an example would be a tribe which cared little about whether or not polar bears exist, while somewhat conceding that if the researchers were convinced they saw these white bears, then they exist for the researchers, but still do not 'exist' for themselves (the tribesmen) - the question itself made little sense to them.",3.0,1,1,1

A comment I’ve usually seen on social media in regards to women not wanting to go to a certain place or take an Uber or talk to a random guy because they fear being raped/assaulted...is that a rational position to have?
I’m a minority man. I’m probably in the top percentile of those who are liable to being assaulted. Men get assaulted more than women in all facets except for sexual assault. As somebody who’s been jumped, robbed, gotten their nose broken, etc on several occasions yet has also been sexually assaulted by a man, I guarantee that it isn’t as bad as being downright raped...I mean just two weeks ago, some guy tried robbing me, probably like the 10-15th time that’s happened to me in my life. 
Still, I don’t try to avoid certain routes, I don’t fear for my life when I go outside, I might be a little more paranoid but I haven’t exactly let that control my life. 
Maybe it’s just me but I feel like social media has kind of given people a misconstrued perspective on sexual assault, making it seem like it happens way more often than not, despite statistics dropping 75% over the past 30 years. Now whether that means that sexual assault is going down or people are too afraid to report it, I’m not sure. I would personally argue that the statistics have gone down because well, folks were too afraid to report it back then. 
Sorry if I went a little off topic. I somewhat take offense to people not wanting to deal with men because they have this fear. And before you say “if you’re offended, you’re part of the problem” that’s a logical fallacy and isn’t a legitimate argument. 
I mean I’ve had people cross the street when they see me, I try to cough really loud when walking behind a woman, etc. I understand the fear and it ain’t my place to change it but still, I just don’t think that prejudice and generalizations are the way to go. I’ve been robbed and beat up by mostly black dudes, if I use that as a justification for not wanting to hang out with black people, I would rightfully be called racist. 
Of course, be vigilant and pay attention to who you’re speaking to but at the same time, I don’t think it’s fair to be skeptical of every person you meet simply because they’re of the opposite sex. 
FWIW, I don’t give a shit if women acknowledge me or not. I’m not speaking about a specific instance but moreso the general social media culture that has sort of bred these ideals.","As women we have been told our ENTIRE lives we need to protect ourselves from men who will do us harm. We’ve been told not to wear certain clothes, to carry mace, not to walk alone at night, don’t get too drunk, or we might get sexually assaulted, raped, kidnapped, or murdered. Like somehow it’s on us to make sure we don’t get hurt. 
I would check this out: https://www.boredpanda.com/nut-kicking-analogy-brett-kavanaugh-case/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic
A man on twitter wrote about women’s experiences from a male perspective to help men better understand what women go through. It’s pretty impactful and I thought it did a pretty good job getting the point across. 
I don’t think the fear of sexual assault is irrational. Women are sexually assaulted all the time and never report it. I personally know many women who have been raped, molested, sexually assaulted, and/or harassed who have never reported it to the police. Men as well. People are recently starting to come out about it because the #MeToo movement has given women a platform to speak out and courage to fight back. 
Personally I do not like living in fear. I try not to worry about being attacked but it is always - I mean ALWAYS - in the back of my mind particularly if I am alone and/or outside at night. While most people and most men for that matter have no intention of hurting women, there are a large number of them who do have bad intentions. Just look at what’s going on in the news with Epstein and Trump taking advantage of little girls years ago. Unfortunately men have been predatory toward women for a long long time people are just now starting to speak up about it and say “no, this is not right and this is not ok.”
Anyways, long response but I hope this gives you some more perspective. Also I am very sorry to hear that you personally have been the victim of violence and sexual assault. No one deserves to be hurt or taken advantage of.",25.0,1,1,1

[...] It could be that the child, with his own sexuality, may have desired that adult, he may even have consented, he may even have made the first moves. We may even agree that it was he who seduced the adult; but we specialists with our psychological knowledge know perfectly well that even the seducing child runs a risk, in every case, of being damaged and traumatized by the fact that he or she has had sexual dealings with an adult. [...] It is therefore within the new legislative framework - basically intended to protect certain vulnerable sections of the population with the establishment of a new medical power - that a conception of sexuality and above all of the relations between child and adult sexuality will be based; and it is one that is extremely questionable.](https://www.uib.no/sites/w3.uib.no/files/attachments/foucaultdangerchildsexuality_0.pdf)

>""We took great care to speak exclusively of an indecent act not involving violence and incitement of a minor to commit an indecent act. We were extremely careful not to touch, in any way, on the problem of rape, which is totally different.""

>""When we say that children are 'consenting' in these cases, all we intend to say is this: in any case, there was no violence, or organized manipulation in order to wrench out of them affective or erotic relations"", he completed.

This means that you can't really control for its effects (this is one of the main reasons for the low quality of studies in video games impacts, for instance).

* For starters, one should look at the foundation of America when it was formed - it was meant to be the ideal place of libertarianism, except for a few demographics who had limited rights such as women [(particularly married women)](https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/essay/legal-status-women-1776%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C1830), [Native Americans](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-amgovernment/chapter/civil-rights-for-indigenous-groups-native-americans-alaskans-and-hawaiians/), and the [African Americans](https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/colonial-america-american-revolution-learning-resources/american-revolution-essays-timelines-images/african-americans-and-the-american-revolution/) (who were still slaves at the time)
* Similar to the ironies mentioned above, there are still a few mentalities that still persist even though certain mentalities have been tackled with in the past since the Civil Rights Movements such as [racism against African Americans](https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes#section-0) (although racist attitudes have decreased throughout the decades), [attitudes towards Muslims](https://www.pewforum.org/2017/02/15/americans-express-increasingly-warm-feelings-toward-religious-groups/) (which is still somewhat in the middle, not overall positive) and [attitudes towards immigrants](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/12/americans-immigration-policy-priorities-divisions-between-and-within-the-two-parties/) (which is divided between both parties)
* Attitudes towards war as America is often are often divided into two - [those who see America as a global police](https://www.npr.org/2008/02/20/19180589/should-america-be-the-worlds-policeman) and while also seen as a [warmonger because of its military-industrial complex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325813242_Military_Industrial_Complex_A_catalyst_for_conflicts_and_wars); or similar to America being seen as advocate for peace, there is still an issue about [purchasing firearms in America](https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/19/news/guns-background-checks/index.html) and [gun control](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12485) and incidents[ involving firearms in America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081)
* Attitudes towards alcohol in America are both [revered](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/americans-alcohol-study_n_598dcce8e4b09071f69932fd) yet also [stigmatised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998202/)
* Attitudes towards sex in America are both [revered](https://www.deseret.com/2011/7/31/20206966/sex-and-television-how-america-went-from-i-love-lucy-to-playboy-club#zooey-deschanel-top-stars-with-damon-wayans-jr-jake-johnson-max-greenfield-and-hannah-simone-in-new-girl) or [accepted](https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/changes-americans-attitudes-sex-reviewing-40-years-data/) and also [stigmatised](http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/genderandsexualitylawblog/files/2012/04/Sexual-Stigma-and-Sexual-Prejudice-in-the-United-States-A-Conceptual-Framework.pdf) (although this study is a bit old)

I cannot think of any more ironies to point out but I feel the pattern is clear - it is as though the culture of America has lots of ironies ... how come?","Thanks for your question to /r/AskSocialScience.

Social media has allowed women to be at the forefront of choosing a dating partner without the input of other men. They can 'window-shop' and judge a man solely by how he presents and perceives himself compared to how other men perceive him. Before women would observe how a man fit in with other men (e.g. how dominant they were, how competent they were compared to their peers) and select the men based on this.
However women are biased by their sexual attraction to males, which influences how she perceives the mans character i.e. more physically attractive to women means better character subconsciously during first impressions.
Of course after dating for a period of time she can better judge a mans character but other things get in the way. They become infatuated by the man due to the chemicals released during sex (nowadays sex ofter happens very early in the relationship not after marriage when the woman could better judge the man she was dating without the hormones released during sex) and this in turn means that they are more biased.

At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.
On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:
* They’re universal across human cultures 
* They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
* Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
* The underlying traits are highly heritable
* They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.
Personality differences
Women, on average, have more:
* Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
   * These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
* Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher agreeableness
   * This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences and there’s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men without support.
* Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance)
   * This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.
Note that contrary to what a social constructionist would argue, research suggests that ""greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits."" Because as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality traits becomes wider.” We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.
Men’s higher drive for status
We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.
Status is the primary metric that men are judged on4, pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths.
Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap
Below I'll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits between men and women that I outlined in the previous section and suggest ways to address them to increase women's representation in tech without resorting to discrimination. Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I think it's still instructive to list them:
* Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things
   * We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits to how people-oriented certain roles at Google can be and we shouldn't deceive ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our programs to get female students into coding might be doing this).
* Women on average are more cooperative
   * Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. Recent updates to Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there's more we can do
   * This doesn't mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn't necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like what's been done in education.
* Women on average are more prone to anxiety
   * Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.
* Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average
   * Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech
* The male gender role is currently inflexible
   * Feminism has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a society, allow men to be more ""feminine,"" then the gender gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for traditionally ""feminine"" roles
Philosophically, I don't think we should do arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women. For each of these changes, we need principled reasons for why it helps Google; that is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google's diversity being a component of that. For example, currently those willing to work extra hours or take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and if we try to change that too much, it may have disastrous consequences. Also, when considering the costs and benefits, we should keep in mind that Google's funding is finite so its allocation is more zero-sum than is generally acknowledged.","The response? Very sexist. Amusingly blind to how sexist it is.

**Perhaps most importantly. Even if Damon is right, it is a reason for Google to discriminate against men, not women. Every single thing he mentions is a reason why women are BETTER employees for Google than men. Teamwork, perhaps largest among all. If you seriously believe in a biological difference in psychology, that is a reason for Google to NOT hire men. Do you really want to go down that path? Everything you list - showing more interest in people building than things, being cooperative/a good teammate, being more aware of potential dangers to self/team/company, being more balanced in life & less likely to pursue extreme, unhealthy behavior, the supposed superiority of women in overcoming bad social messaging. Everything you list is a reason for people like Damon - or you - to never be hired by Google when they could hire a woman instead. And you argue this is reality?**

> They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
True for none of the differences Damon has claimed to have observed.

Irrelevant to the traits Damon claimed to have observed. And to your above statements, obviously (David Reimer was still subject to social messaging).
> The underlying traits are highly heritable
True for none of the differences Damon claimed to have observed. AND irrelevant to gender differences. (The overwhelming majority of our genetics is not on the Y chromosome & therefore not specific to either gender.)

That is incorrect. It comes from an ignorance of evolutionary theory & pre-history mankind.
> Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” 
Great. So we can stop right here, acknowledge Damon was wrong and an idiot for not taking into account individual differences being self-selected by chosen field, toss his junk into the garbage on the basis of the above statement alone, right?
No, we can't? Because you're just saying that as a ""don't truthfully tell me that I like discrimination"" disclaimer rather than actually admitting Damon was wrong and an idiot? Because you actually like the idea of discrimination like Damon proposed? Sigh. Let's continue.
> I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences
You have absolutely zero scientific basis for this. It was pulled out of your ass. Or you believed the shit pulled out of someone's ass.
I know this because of the basics of philosophy of science. It is not possible for us to construct scientific experiments to prove what you said because it is not possible for us to construct scientific experiments that are free of social pressures/impacts on psychology. Including gender roles. The variable of social training cannot be removed, ergo there is no possible scientific proof to your claims. It is important to remember again that these supposed psychological differences are NOT found across all cultures.
> Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
Even if, for the sake of argument, we believe this is true, there is no reason to believe that isn't the result of training. Women receive vastly more training in the above as a child than men do, on average. So there is zero reason to believe in consistent underlying gender psychology. Just in the effectiveness of training.
> These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
More guesses pulled out of your or someone's ass and treated as if they are real. And, lest we forget, who cares? Individuals at Google, even if they are unusual individuals, do not deserve discrimination because other people of their gender are different from them.
>  research suggests that ""greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits.""
Correlation does not equal causation. Please look it up. Also, such research has nothing to do with capability at performing in a tech company.
> We always ask why we don't see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.
This betrays a shocking ignorance of what higher-status jobs are actually like. Did you think company leaders are treated like mid-level managers? LOL, no. Being tried & stressed leads to bad strategic decisions. It would be foolishness to the point of losing vast amounts of profit for a company to work its higher-status people like you suggest they do. Once again, I have to point out that, if you are right, it shows that men are vastly inferior for high-level leadership jobs. Where knowing people's skills and being able to delegate tasks to free up executive time is incredibly important & being too status-hungry to relinquish controlling authority is pretty dumb & inefficient.
> Status is the primary metric that men are judged on
LOL, nice job othering women without even realizing it. Status is also the primary metric we use for women. It is the sources of social status that differ, not status itself.
> Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths
This is just ignorant. Those forces are called sexism preventing women from being hired. Women not wanting those jobs is not at all why women are not in those jobs. And you have zero research showing so (I know, because there is no actual research showing so). Again, pulling shit out of your ass & believing it because you want to believe it. Don't worry though. I recognize you are a unique individual and are not using your example to assume all men are this ignorant of science & use of evidence.
> Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap
No need. By your own description, women are a vastly superior employee. Just remove the sexism preventing women's success and - according to you - there will be a different gender gap, with men locked out of corporate leadership & tech.

Of course I believe there is inequality , I believe both men and women face inequality in different ways but undoubtedly the system benefits men more.
To the point:
I disagreed and said that although men might have contributed majority to most of the issues present , that social structure has been formed over thousands of years / maybe even millions of  years of hierarchical bias towards men ultimately leading to a complex structure of how we perceive each of the genders.   
  
I said it was a bit absurd to claim that every single issue women face is ultimately caused by men. 
  
I believe that for every single issue , the cause has both a male and female influence, and for each of those influences that there’s a reason that’s the way it is which both male and female have played into etc...this continues on. In my head it’s super interlinked. By no means do I think there is equal blame.

Furthermore, I have no problems with transwomen or using people's preferred pronouns, not that it matters whether I have a problem with it, even if I did. This question is less about my perspective and more about the outlooks of others. Namely, objections to the inclusion of transwomen in women's spaces and the future of lesbianism.
As a sort of secondary note, which I think is necessary given that these topics are somewhat contentious in nature, I recognize that not acknowledging transwomen as being like any other woman, despite their genitalia, contributes to the general transphobic sentiment in society, and that this transphobic sentiment commonly results in violence against trans people, particularly transwomen. I likewise recognize that transwomen are often unfairly accused of licentiousness when they are, to my knowledge, more likely to be victims of sexual violence than to perpetrate it (and, among all women and men, only a small portion engage in violent crime of any sort, anyway).
That said, I sometimes find myself sympathizing with the women dubbed ""TERFs,"" though I don't share their fears at present. I consider that I might feel uncomfortable changing in a room with someone with a penis if I were a woman, even if they were woman-identifying. Naturally, underlying that would be my own prejudice regarding gender, which I think, obviously, is a social construct (as opposed to biological sex, which is a separate concept). Therein lies another related issue, however: the matter of lesbianism and sapphic relations.
How does a lesbian woman who is not attracted to penis reconcile refusing to date transwomen who have a penis? Is not the act of refusing to date transwomen because of their genitalia an admission that they are not ""like regular (cis) women""? It seems to me that lesbians must either accept pre-op transwomen as being like any other (cis) women, and therefore accept dating someone with a penis, or they must make the admission that pre-op transwomen are not ""real"" women because of their penis, and therefore betray their transphobia.
There does not appear to be a medium between the two, as best I can tell. In fact, from my observations, there looks to be a modest rising conflict between these two evidently antithetical notions, pitting some lesbians against the progressive queer or trans movement. So, to reiterate my question on this subject, how do progressive lesbians resolve this conflict for themselves, where it is a conflict?

I could go on, but you get the picture. 
If we want to tell young girls that they can do whatever they set their minds to, why can't early pregnancy be one of the options? I get that lots of women are forced into being baby carriers by culture and by religion, but this is not true if you live in liberal societies, yet these stereotypes/prejudices continue to persist.
A liberal woman who starts motherhood earlier than 30 is not worth lesser and should not have her with-child status held against her any more than a child bride in a third world country should have her lack of formal education held against her. If the young woman is happy being a young mum, it's *her* choice, people need to get over their need to judge her.","So it's worth pointing out that I don't think this shaming is as universal in ""liberal societies"" (whatever that is supposed to refer to? I'm unclear) as you seem to think. Cultural norms around children/marriage/pregnancy vary a lot, not only between countries but also within them. In the U.S. for instance, both New York and Chicago are both very liberal cities, but they have markedly different economies, geography, costs of living, histories, religious makeup, racial and ethnic demographics, etc. and as such you would expect a lot of cultural norms to be different. 
The other big elephant in the room is race and class and the way they intersect. In general, lower-income people (who in the US are in general more likely to be black or Hispanic) are more likely to have children younger. This means that the stigma around teen pregnancy (or to a lesser extent having a baby before you are established in your career), is associated with being lower class. 
In reality, of course, this is not because there is something wrong with low-income people, but because low-income people tend to have less sex education and less access to reliable reproductive healthcare, including the more expensive but more reliable means of contraception. But classism is a bitch and doesn't really care about logic. 
As you kind of hint at in your ask, this prejudice tends to disproportionately affect women because sexism is also a bitch like that. But in my experience, it's rooted mostly in classism. 
(That said, teen pregnancy specifically tends to lead to worse economic and educational outcomes for girls and for their kids. Girls who get pregnant and decide they want to have the baby should absolutely be supported and shouldn't be shamed, but the way you seem to frame young motherhood, including teen motherhood as empowering is...maybe something you should re-examine? I hope I'm getting the wrong impression there. Teen motherhood is really tough.)",14.0,1,1,1

**1:** prejudice or discrimination based on sex*especially* **:** discrimination against women **2:** behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.
Let's say Tom likes to cold approach women in public and he thinks that's a good behaviour because he would appreciate being cold approached, can Tom be considered sexist? He's not treating women unfairly, instead he's using the same standards for women and himself - a man. I'm making this example because a lot of women, even in this sub, claim that cold approaching is sexist because it annoys people yet they forget that a lot of men who do this would apppreciate being cold approached by random women, they just treat women like they - men - want to be treated. Tom likes to have sex with as many women as possible and doesn't have high standards since he has a very high libido so he would also like to be approached by a lot of women everywhere, yes I'm depicting the typical PUA.
Let's say Tom is bisexual and goes to a place where most men are gay, Tom begins to cold approach men just like he does with women. I'm making this example because I think that men like Tom would do the same even with men if they were gay, as a matter of fact gay men are much more direct and sexual when it comes to approaching other men from my experience and everyone can see the same trend in gay culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that [gay men are the most promiscuous demographics, while straight people are average and lesbian womenare the least promiscuous demographics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201006/homosexuality-queer-problem).
I'm making this post for another reason too, I think that the typical dating advice ""treat women like normal human beings"" that feminists often give to men doesn't work since many men would like to be cold approached and they definitely think of themselves as human beings. I know that women fear men because they can be dangerous for various reasons like strenght and criminal propensity (men are over-represented in every type of crime) and I think that explaining this gender difference is more helpful than just saying ""treat women equally"" or other variants that put importance on the equality of treatment. Explaining women's issues with safety to men would be more helpful in deterring men from cold approaching women and from my experience is the best argument to convince my male friends and acquaintances from participating in PUA's behavious.
I also think that there are gender differences in sexuality that explain why men and women don't agree on cold approaching, I've explained them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/colxzb/can_the_sexual_objectification_of_women_be_a/) but basically I argue that men are more visual, this means that men are more likely to be aroused by random women while women just notice men without necessarily having a strong sexual response so they are unlikely to see cold approaching favourably. This is not the point that I want to make with this post so you can ignore this last paragraph.","you recognise that perhaps there are gender differences in feelings on being cold approached and that men like it and women don't but the argue its therefore not sexist to cold approach a woman because men like it? do you even know what you're trying to argue?  If women are constantly staating that they/we don't like being cold approached, and men decide 'fuck that, I like it so they must' then yes, you're discriminating against women's decisions and preferences for what happens to them",14.0,1,1,1

I am looking for advice and possibly some source feminist reading material from this group. I would like to find sources to refer to so that I can be more informed when it comes to conversations about the historical contributions of women. For context, I am a demi-bisexual woman getting a Ph.D. in a male-dominated field in STEM. Yesterday I was having a conversation with a male friend of mine from college.  He is an educated ex-marine, and I think fairly progressively in his beliefs. I told him that I enjoyed having female friends more than male friends because my female friends have historically been more supportive of me than male friends. I also admitted that I do have a few male friends, but overall I don't enjoy the ""every man for himself"" mentality I have encountered among male friendships. Men tend to bond through competition. Women tend to bond through conversation. I remember learning this concept in my gender studies class in undergrad. Is it possible I learned it incorrectly? He told me that my statements were problematic because men have historically worked together beautifully and are just as supportive as women if not in different ways. I was a bit surprised that he would say this. He said that I was more or less ""making stuff up"" based on my personal bias, but I was thinking about how women have historically been assigned a role in the home to support and raise families while men have been given positions of power.  I was unsure about how to approach the conversation. Does anyone have any reading material I could look at to have more informed conversations about gender dynamics and the supportive role that women have historically played in our society? It's been a long time since I have read a feminist text. I would like to broach the subject with him again after some preparation. How might I have this conversation constructively?","Some books that I would recommend:
* *Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center* by bell hooks
   * This book covers a wide range and functions as an introduction. 
      * It benefits by giving a clear and quotable definition of Feminism: as the Movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.
      * It critiques some earlier feminist thinking and where it went wrong. Mainly the white liberal feminism that didn't notice the existence of Women of color in the workforce.
      * It covers how men are and can also be victims to sexist oppression.
* *Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics* by bell hooks
   * Another introductory book by hooks.
      * This book covers a wider range of topics while the previous looked at the feminist movement and how it could benefit from starting at the margins of society instead of being centered on white women, that a white women feminism is victim to white supremacy.
      * This book covers such things as Politics, Education, Class Struggle, Global Feminism, Reproductive Rights, Marriage, Feminist Parenting, Feminist Masculinity, and more
      * This book and the previous help to show the reader how the perception of Feminism was shaped by our patriarchal media system. This is not a conspiracy theory; rather, the media was able to choose Feminist idols that were visible and easy to tear down as wacky.
* *The Essential Feminist Reader* by Estelle B. Freedman
   * This is a collection of works organized chronologically by Freedman
      * You wanted something that would show the historical presence of women, and this book can do that. 
      * The earliest document in this book comes from Christine De Pizan, France, 1405. Although, most of its documents come from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
      * This book is not just European and American, it includes sources from India, China, Mexico, Zimbabwe and more.
      * The entries are all rather short, and some are more philosophical and other are more literary. 
      * I have only read selections out of it, so I don't know how helpful it would be in specific situations of conflict.
These are all simple books I'd recommend. One book that I'm not recommending because I never see it quoted and I believe it may be sort of out of date is *Women's Choices: Philosophical Problems Facing Feminism* by Mary Midgley and Judith Hughes. The reason, however, why I bring it up is that the authors said something that has stuck with me. When they were writing the book, pre-1983, the feminist movement, as they saw it, has a strange relation with history. As the authors say,

For those reasons i can be nothing but a feminist. Women want equality? We should all strive for it. Equality of RESPONSIBILITIES. No cherry picking of traditional values and priviledges. No double standards, misandry and prejudice against men. No ""fairer gender"" treatment or special passes. Let there at last be EQUALITY. Equality makes the world a better place for everyone.","Yeah, you’re not a feminist. You’re a baby MGTOW/redpiller.

Let's look at the definition of sexism
**1:** prejudice or discrimination based on sex*especially* **:** discrimination against women **2:** behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.
Let's say Tom likes to cold approach women in public and he thinks that's a good behaviour because  he would appreciate being cold approached, can Tom be considered sexist?  He's not treating women unfairly, instead he's using the same standards for women and himself - a man.  I'm making this example because a lot of women, even in this sub, claim that cold approaching is sexist because it annoys people yet they forget that a lot of men who do this would apppreciate being cold approached by random women, they just treat women how they would like to be treated. Tom likes to have sex with as many women as possible and doesn't have high standards since he has a very high libido so he would also like to be approached by a lot of women everywhere, yes I'm depicting the typical PUA.
Let's say Tom is bisexual and goes to a place where most men are gay,  Tom begins to cold approach men just like he does with women.  I'm making this example because I think that  men like Tom would do the same even with men if they were gay, as a matter of fact gay men are much more direct and sexual when it comes to approaching other men from my experience and everyone can see the same trend in gay culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that [gay men are the most promiscuous demographics, while straight people are average  and lesbian womenare the least promiscuous demographics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201006/homosexuality-queer-problem). 
I'm making this post for another reason too, I think that the typical  dating advice ""treat women like normal human beings"" that feminist often give to men doesn't work since many men would like to be cold approached and they definitely think of themselves as human beings.  I know that women fear men because they can be dangerous for various reasons like strenght and criminal propensity (men are over-represented in every type of crime and their main victims are other men) and I think that explaining this gender difference is more helpful than just saying ""treat women equally"" or other variants that put importance on the equality of treatment. Explaining women's issues with safety to men would more helpful in deterring men from cold approaching women and from my experience is the best argument  to convince my male friends acquaintances from participating in PUA's behavious.
I also think that there are gender differences in sexuality  that explain why men and women don't agree on cold approaching, I've explained them [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/colxzb/can_the_sexual_objectification_of_women_be_a/) but basically I argue that men are more visual , it means that men are more likely to be aroused by random women while women just notice men without  necessarily having a strong sexual response so they're unlikey to see cold approaching favourably.  This is not the point that I want to make with this post so you can ignore this last paragraph.","Oh shit y'all, he brought the dictionary. Sorry, not trying to be snarky but... seriously? You're in a feminism sub and you thought the best way to start your post is by copy/pasting the first hit when you type in ""sexism"" on google? 
Despite the fact that this is pretty clearly a ""gotcha, feminists!"" ask, I'll try to answer your question. 
Staggering misunderstandings of queer culture aside, it's not sexist to approach women in public, make conversation, and introduce yourself. The thing is though, most of the time, the way y'all do it is super sexist. 
Some things to keep in mind when doing this: 
Women do not owe you their attention. Or even their politeness. If she doesnt give it to you, nothing has been deprived from you. 
Give her an ""out."" I remember men who have said things like ""I don't mean to make this too personal, but do you have a boyfriend?"" Or ""If you have somewhere to be, please don't let me keep you""  (not in a passive aggressive way) fondly, because they're giving me a chance at a graceful exit by acknowledging that I might not want to or be able to talk to them. 
Learn to read body language. She probably doesn't want to talk to you, straight up. Think about how you would feel if you were approached by some random dude in public. Learn to excuse yourself and duck out after she clearly isnt into it.
Treat her like a human being. This post kind of makes you seem like you have a chip on your shoulder about women who complain about street harassment. Not a good look. Have some empathy. 
The reality is, though, even if you're awesome, many women have just experienced a lot of street harrassment, and for a lot of us, the handsomest guy would come up to us and be incredibly polite and we would *still* feel a little put off/on the spot/uncomfortable. The thing with cold approaching is you're almost certainly gonna creep some people out, and almost certainly gonna experience rejection, probably not too nicely either. I'd stick with trying to build up acquaintanceships with girls you meet parties, through friends, ect, and asking them out after yall have had some sparks.",3.0,1,1,1

Another false thing that a lot of us are doing is practising misandry, such as cancelling international men's day (what? I thought we were all about equality??) Another common example is when some people in our groups send things like ""boys need to be taught not to rape"", portraying them as rapist animals (isn't this gender prejudice?) 
I personally believe these very blatantly wrong beliefs shine a negative light on our community and some are just absurd to think about, but if it is so easy for a feminist (me) to go research for 2 minutes about something or use my brain to process that what some of us are fighting for isn't equality, then why are so many of us still practising it?",Take your disingenuous trolling elsewhere.

>You are absolutely correct. So let's move past our fixation on physical and sexual violence and take a look at emotional violence and the internalization of gender roles. As I've noted elsewhere, it is curious how when men internalize their assigned gender to the point where it becomes harmful to themselves and those around them, it's ""toxic masculinity"", but when women internalize their assigned gender to the point where it becomes harmful to themselves and those around them, it's ""internalized misogyny"".

>Most child abusers are women, based on CPS estimates that are primarily concerned with physical and sexual abuse. Female abusers are far more likely to use emotional violence, which is far less likely to be reported, taken seriously, or even perceived as abuse by the victim. I didn't realize my mother was emotionally abusive until I was 26 and had been hospitalized multiple times for symptoms none of the doctors recognized as being consistent with CPTSD and a history of emotional abuse and neglect. Tellingly, I realized it after reading a book that was written by and for female victims of male abusers.

After all, they're our mothers. We're supposed to love them unconditionally for everything they did for us and look past their faults and abuses. Our fathers who slaved away at a job they hated for twenty years in order to give us a better life are somehow not owed the same understanding and gratitude.

>You're backtracking from your original claim that emotional violence is just as or more potent a weapon than physical violence. To the extent that men are more physically violent, I would note that ""boys will be boys"" - a sentiment I have only ever heard expressed by women - cuts both ways. Boys are allowed (by their predominately female caretakers) to get away with things girls are not allowed to get away with, but they are also expected to fend and stand up for themselves in a way that girls are not. When authority won't help, boys on the playground learn that violence is sometimes the only way to ensure their safety and emotional well-being. That doesn't justify their violence as adults - especially violence in intimate relationships - but that brings us back to the original question of agency in the internalization of gender roles.

>*How is it that our general legal understanding of domestic vio-lence as defined by the male abuse of women is so squarely contra-dicted by the empirical reality? Honestly answering this question re-quires tracing the history of both the theory and practice of domestic violence law. Undertaking such an exploration, one quickly finds that the “discovery” of domestic violence is rooted in the essential feminist tenet that society is controlled by an all-encompassing patriarchal structure.8 This fundamental feminist understanding of domestic violence has far-reaching implications. By dismissing the possibility of female violence, the framework of legal programs and social norms is narrowly shaped to respond only to the male abuse of women. Fe-male batterers cannot be recognized. Male victims cannot be treated. If we are to truly address the phenomenon of domestic violence, the legal response to domestic violence and the biases which underlie it must be challenged.*

>The social sciences are female-dominated and gender studies and women's studies in particular are 72% and 92% female respectively. I have no data on men's studies because it's usually considered a sub-discipline of women's studies, which is revealing in and of itself. If you really believe that representation matters and that a diversity of perspective is required in order to arrive at the truth, you should take findings that validate patriarchal/feminist assumptions about men with more than just a single grain of salt.

>Because the arrest rate of blacks for offenses that don’t “hinge on police discretion,” like violent crimes, also systematically exceeds their proportion of the population.

>Researching crime rates to see if white police are behaving in a discriminatory manner when it comes to non-“discretional” crimes like murder or robbery.
First, properly to understand crime figures, you have to realize that Ferguson, Missouri is a community devastated by sudden white flight. 
>The city is currently 70 percent black, but this is a very recent development.
>In 1970,Ferguson was 99 percent white  
>In 1980, Ferguson was 85 percent white and 14 black
>In 1990, Ferguson was 73.8 percent white and 25.1 percent black
>In 2000, Ferguson was 44.8 percent white and 52.4 percent black
>By 2010 Ferguson was 29.3 percent white and 67.4 percent black
>Since the Supreme Court declared Restrictive Covenants on property unconstitutional, and with Federal government openly working to impose diversity on white America through “Fair Housing,” Section 8, refugee resettlement etc., no city can protect itself against the kind of white flight we’ve seen over a 40 year time period in Ferguson.
>Once whites leave the city, the tax base erodes, property values plummet, and only certain kinds of businesses can feasibly stay open and turn a profit.  I call this effect the “Black Undertow.” This is what happened to Ferguson, and the riots have only accelerated the flight of human capital from the city.
>These numbers are nearly a complete match to the crime statistics I pulled from the City of St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Annual Report to the Community, which breaks down the arrests rates for violent crime by race (you can research 1999-2012 at the site).
>In other words, black criminality in and around Ferguson is systematic and long-standing. And as the proportion of blacks in Ferguson rose, the absolute amount of crime increased even more dramatically.
He makes the same point here: https://donotlink.it/1J2lQ
Apparently when blacks move in, they scare the poor decent whites away. 
This has a number of false assumptions in my mind.
First off Blacks never really had the same housing rights of whites:

This isn't even getting into how banks were using race-based predatory loans then defaulting on them:

So this goes a long way towards explaining the lowering of property values. Heck whites were convinced by these same lenders to leave in the first place: https://medium.com/@DmitriMehlhorn/a-requiem-for-blockbusting-68152244e77a
So it's not like blacks could even have the same option of leaving. Large numbers of poor black families live in hyper-segregated neighborhoods with limited access to opportunity.
As for crime rates blacks are increased for the same crimes whites do, but while the later goes free the former gets overly harsh sentences:

Notice how blacks are searched more often yet few weapons are found on them, while it is the reverse for whites?
That’s because not all criminal activity is reported and not all laws are applied equally. Police departments already disproportionately police and surveil poor communities and communities of color.
Certain communities, often white and middle-class, that place greater trust in police departments are more likely to report crimes and Black communities are more likely to be reported as suspected of committing crimes. 
Hell white kids avoid discipline and suspension, while minorities don't! And it isn't because minorities are evil: 
https://www.pnas.org/content/116/17/8255 
https://supportiveschooldiscipline.org/learn/reference-guides/discipline-disparities
We only know about reported and solved crimes, and the bias in favor of white victims of black people is there. Poor, black victims are not generating as much interest, which is known and pretty much incontroversial.
Then there are the cops actively supporting the racists as well: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/21/police-white-nationalists-racist-violence

I too subscribe to the idea that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum and is not by itself ""controlling"" and shaping every one from the every-day user to the CEO of techno-corporations.
Where I've been confused, though, is whether I've missed a point if I, *at times*, just focus on what the technology ""does"" to the user. I realize that a company creates the technology and the user uses the technology so whatever the media ""does"" to the user, is by extension, the company doing something to the user. But, with that in mind, is it academically or intellectually unsound to occasionally just focus on the technology 🡢user and user 🡢 technology dynamic?
During my studies, I have written plenty of papers about technology with topics such as:
1. Clickbait and Fake News \[where I am critical of how news outlets use specific social media tools to 'disguise' the truth\]
2. Bias in coding \[where I am critical of coders and code being neutral. Even in seemingly 'neutral' things like childrens apps\]
3. Difference between eBooks and paper books \[where I am *only* analyzing how the ebook changes the way people read in certain situations\]
4. How the online forums and message boards can impact the social life people who live in isolated, rural areas \[how subcultures such as underground punk rock can now reach a isolated rural areas because of internet message boards\]
Now, 1 and 2 on that list take on the idea of power structures, politics and the companies and people who are building these technologies as well as how these companies with or without them knowing it, are ""shaping"" society through their technology in certain ways.
In the papers 3 and 4 on that list, I only looked to analyze the specific technology and its affordances from a user standpoint. My use of an eBook reader the last 10 years has definitely shaped the way I read books. For example, if I go on a vacation, I can now bring hundreds of digital books without it taking up more space in my suitcase. That means that the eBook reader changes the way I  go on vacation. It might even change the way I experience a foreign country, because now I can bring 20 different history books about the place I am visiting instead of just one book. Or maybe, on the other hand, because I have so much reading material, I tend to stay more in bed in the hotel room rather than actually explore the place I'm visiting.
Now, I *could* have also written about how eBook-retailers are changing the book economy or how user data is collected by the companies in order to get me to read certain authors or buy certain books. But the fact was that I usually had a limit of 20-25 pages to write and I found it interesting how this new medium changed the way took in literature.
I do understand the problem with saying, in a general way, ""technology shapes us and it shapes society"", because of course economic, social and power structures are intrinsically built into technology by the people creating these technologies, whether it be a huge multinational corporation or a non-profit coder on GitHub releasing her software for free. But is there also a place for *just* analyzing what technology does to me while avoiding the trap of technological determinism? I would say that there definitely are places where the larger political power structures are less important to an analysis. For example:
While being bedridden a while back, I spent a lot of time on Instagram and I found an old friend. I started following his profile and his daily updates where he was out in the wild nature (walking in forests, hiking in mountains, etc.)
This person's Instagram profile changed my plans for after my rehab. I had planned to start swimming daily at the local indoor pool, but because I saw so many pictures and videos of incredible locations in nature, I started planning daily hiking trips instead of swimming. Seeing pictures of nature daily simply reminded me how much I enjoy being in nature.
I know that me viewing this friend's profile made me part of an advanced algorithm on Instagram and my activity and the way I used the app all relates back to the designers, coders and company politics of Instagram, but if I had to write a paper on ""How does viewing nature profiles on Instagram affect rehab patients"", then I personally think that the fact that I was exposed and in which ways I was exposed to nature imagery, would be more interesting to explore than the political / power structures of Instagram. The fact that I was able to ask my friend in a comment ""where is this place?"" or the fact that I could re-watch the videos again and again made the experience different than watching a TV show about nature for example.
I have taken classes over the years that have tended to be more deterministic such as ""User interaction in online communities"" and less deterministic such as ""Bias and privacy concerns in digital coding"". I feel like I've learned a lot from both of these perspectives.
Am I missing the whole point of technological determinism? In what ways?",This submission has been removed as it's not a specific and answerable social science question.,1.0,1,1,1

Not including homosexuals, men only judge other men on their character and not on their sexual attraction. Of course subconsciously, objective standards of positive physical attributes (e.g. symmetrical face) can bias a mans opinion of another man, most of it is to do with the mans character and use in a society.
Social media has allowed women to be at the forefront of choosing a dating partner without the input of other men. They can 'window-shop' and judge a man solely by how he presents and perceives himself compared to how other men perceive him. Before women would observe how a man fit in with other men (e.g. how dominant they were, how competent they were compared to their peers) and select the men based on this.
However women are biased by their sexual attraction to males, which influences how she perceives the mans character i.e. more physically attractive to women means better character subconsciously during first impressions.
Of course after dating for a period of time she can better judge a mans character but other things get in the way. They become infatuated by the man due to the chemicals released during sex (nowadays sex ofter happens very early in the relationship not after marriage when the woman could better judge the man she was dating without the hormones released during sex) and this in turn means that they are more biased.
Men with positive character traits who are physically unattractive cannot get their foot through the door (if women were to solely use online dating which I know is not true but it is increasingly popular) and therefore they are becoming excluded from dating.",Your post history leads me to believe your participation here is in less than good faith.

I’m a member of this sub and I just came across a debate on another platform that I thought was interesting. It was about sexism directed towards men, misandry. 
Some people in this debate thought sexism couldn’t be directed towards men because the foundation of sexism is based on prejudice towards women and therefore it can’t be reversed (kinda like the argument with reversed racism), while some thought sexism towards men could be a thing, just less common and «institutionalized». 
I’m just curious to know your opinions on this? Personally I think misandry is valid and I definetly think men can be victims of sexism, but it might be less common. I feel like «sexism» is more of a general term that describes prejudice based on all genders, while misogony and misandry is more specific. What are your opinions? :)",,,1,1,1

However, it seems that definition has changed and racism is actually supposed to mean discrimination in an institutional sense, where only the people in power can be racist. That's why people now say that ""only white people can be racist"".
But isn't that definition the same as oppression? 
I just think the change of this definition is a bit harmful, because if we say ""minorities can't be racist"" many people can take it as a free past to bigotry and discrimination. 
I'm genuinely curious, sorry if something I said was wrong.",,,1,1,1
