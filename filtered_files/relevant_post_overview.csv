Attention Dashers!! One of our own has recently been HUMILIATED and ROBBED on Twitter. Doordash has yet to comment on the matter.,"A video with nearly 2 million views posted on Twitter shows two boys harassing a Dasher, forcing him to pay out of pocket in order to give them their refund.
Link to video: https://mobile.twitter.com/j_baylorcook/status/1071575501590941698
As far as I can tell, the customers had ordered ice cream from McDonald‚Äôs, as well as some other food. Not surprisingly the ice cream machine from McDonald‚Äôs was out of order. The dasher let the customers know that McDonald‚Äôs was unable to complete the full order, and that they would be receiving a refund for their ice cream FROM Doordash itself. The customers complain and RECORD the whole ordeal, and basically force the Dasher to pay the refund out of his own pocket!!! Guys we‚Äôve all been there, and obviously the Dasher could have just refused to pay them the refund. If you watch the video it is pretty obvious that these two kids just wanted a viral video. Also I hate to make rash judgements but it definitely seems like the poor young man has some kind of social disorder. Give the video a watch and let me know what you think. I find it ridiculous that Doordash has yet to comment on the situation, the least they could do is defend the guy. With nearly 2 million views it seems that Doordash simply does not care about its workers.","This is why the Rating System is bullshit, driver probably gave into those teens demands because he didn‚Äôt want to get rated poorly. The system basically wants you to kiss customers asses and follow their terrorist demands. Also this video proves why we should never carry cash, even though Doordash advises us to for cash tippers. Hopefully the driver got compensated back, these teens learned a early life lesson and DD have better driver support",50.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/a4hqcv/attention_dashers_one_of_our_own_has_recently/,doordash,disorder,a4hqcv,2018-12-08,114,86,Eaglesmoke,1,,n,1,seems like the same video as below,n,Agree,1,Agree,n,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,1.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

"Crazy pax refused to get out, had to call police (LA)","This story happened couple hours ago in LA and I‚Äôm still a bit shaken. To begin with, I‚Äôm a young white immigrant woman with a minor disability (visible but only if you look closely) and some anxiety issues (my safety in particular), lyft is my Friday gig. I carry pepper spray and only drive during the day to avoid drunk passengers.
I was half day through when I got this ping. It‚Äôs a young woman with her 2-3 old cute energetic son. They get inside, kid screams and refuses to get into his car seat. She informs me he‚Äôs autistic and hard to deal with, I said I have a disability as well, I get it. (2,5 minutes left to load.) He reaches to my car shift stick and I push his arms away, saying ‚Äúbaby it‚Äôs dangerous‚Äù. He keeps jumping on my car seats, pushing his legs on my seat, reaching car panel, pulling out napkins etc. She doesn‚Äôt try to stop him. I‚Äôm still patient, hoping eventually she‚Äôs gonna put him in his seat and we‚Äôll go. When 5 minutes passed, I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, unfortunately I have to cancel, there are other passengers waiting for me‚Äù. And there she goes nuts. I tried to distance my thoughts but some phrases I heard:
You discriminate against disabled child, you‚Äôre not f-Ing disabled yourself, you‚Äôre lying, you only care about money and your precious car. You‚Äôre white and racist piece of s***. You are afraid of a 2 year black child. At this point I turned off my car, got ouside and called police because she was still yelling in my car and refused to get out. Police arrived and she finally got out telling me ‚Äúgo get your money btch‚Äù. Her child went running into traffic and police officers had to catch him. She didn‚Äôt have control over her child. Police told me to go and they were talking to her about child engagement. ‚ÄúMam, you put Uber and a phone conversation before your child safety??‚Äù -last officer‚Äôs words I heard before leaving.
Got in the car and found spilled Arizona tea and some shoe prints. Cried my eyes out and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever drive lyft again. My mental state is fragile. I‚Äôve been accused of faking disability, discriminating against disabled child and being racing. I know I‚Äôm not but it feels like she dumped a bucket of shit on my head. I probably won‚Äôt get much reimbursement for a spilled tea, I just hope she gets blocked and gets help with her behavior issues. Her son should be her priority, not public freak outs on people who just try to make ends meet.

Dash anxiety,"Anyone else have major anxiety before they start dashing? Any tips on how to ease it/overcome it? For instance, my first dash always makes me sweat, my heart pounds, I over think everything. What if the customer is scary? What if I can't find their house? What if they yell at me about their food? What if this order is a human trafficking scam? What if the restaurant takes gives me the wrong food and I don't realize it until I'm driving? What if the app fuck in anyway? What if the cops pull me over because of my expired inspection sticker? What if what if what if?
But then usually by the end of the night I don't feel as bad. But lately I've been talking myself out of going to work and just sleeping all day and telling myself I'll dash all day tomorrow, which I rarely ever do. When I do dash I usually dash at 7pm-11-30pm. Idk why I'm like this. I'm in debt and I can't hold down a real job because not only do I have generalized anxiety disorder I also suffer from ptsd, major depressive disorder and chronic migraines...I'm starting to feel suicidal and I'm seeing a therapist.

I wanna use Mturk to help pay for bills too, not just depend on the kindness of my family, who are paying my bills until I get approved for disability.

Low rating for not talking,"So why do passengers think it‚Äôs appropriate to rate drivers low because the driver did not initiate conversation with the passenger? One person rated me as a 2 star drive, and marked communication as the reason why. This was after he mistakenly sent me somewhere else and had to drive another 5 minutes away to him. This isn‚Äôt the first time either just the most recent. I always say ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù at the start of the trip yet it still happens. I have autism which makes it harder for me to talk so it just feels like I‚Äôm getting rated low because of my disability.

Disabled driver needs an assistant. Will Uber allow this?,"I want to become an Uber driver to make a little extra money to help cover the bills. However, I have one problem. I'm disabled. I can drive without issue but I would not be able to help people in and out of the car, assist with their bags at the airport or any other physical needs. If I got sent to another disabled person's home, I definitely would not be able to put their wheelchair in my trunk, since, well my own chair is there.
I can solve most of this problem by bringing my husband with me. He would be dressed well, clean shaven etc., and treat any of our guests with dignity and respect. He would help with bags. He would be quiet and offer whichever seat the rider preferred. He would also be silent through out the ride unless the guest wished to talk to him. He would do the driving himself except he's partially blind.
So my question is, would Uber allow this? I've heard of drivers getting fired for having other people in the car. But this is kind of a delicate situation. Advice? Thoughts?","Uber does not allow drivers to have another person in the car who is not a paying rider. The car has to be able to pick up the max number of riders.
An option would be to indicate that you are disabled in your profile. The riders can read this. However there are a number of riders who do not know of the profile.

Drivers with Disabilities,"Hi /s/uber,
I'm planning to cut back to part-time & freelance for my primary job, & I was considering driving for Uber as an occasional change of pace - I enjoy driving, & am a bit of a social creature, so it seems like a cool thing to pick up for a day or two on slow weeks. I use a wheelchair due to a Spinal Cord Injury 18 years ago. I'm fully licensed, have professionally-engineered hand controls, & once I'm in my car I have no barriers to driving safely. Essentially, the only way to tell I have a disability is from seeing my hands operating the hand controls. I meet all requirements (newer car, background check, etc). By law & de facto, my disability does not impact on my ability to drive so long as my license conditions are met (automatic transition & modified vehicle). The only thing I can foresee that I'm unable to do is anything requiring the driver to be outside the vehicle (helping with luggage, etc).
* Is there anything which asserts that Uber drivers *must* be able to leave the vehicle?
* Is it required that a driver be able & willing to help with luggage etc?
* Can you think of any reason why I'd be less able to perform the inherent duties of the job?
* Are there any drivers that you know of in a similar situation?
* `NEW` My chair takes up most of the boot of my car. Would I be required to make that space available to rides for their luggage?
* `NEW` Are drivers able to advertise (in platform) as ""no luggage"" or similar?","I don't think helping toss someone's 50lb suitcase in the trunk is a requirement. I know drivers that don't help people. They pull up, see they have luggage, and just pop the trunk from the driver's seat. Even though we get shit wages, and it more than likely won't lead to a tip, I help every single time because people are lazy and will just drag their bags across my bumper and damage it.

Anyone ever verify tips?,"It's a sneaking suspicion of mine, but then again I have an anxiety disorder so who knows. My suspicion started when a nice old lady told me she would tip me $5 for my trouble, and later on I see the tip was $4 and change. The time delay makes me suspicious as well, as the only reason I see that we aren't told quickly what our tip is is so that we can't talk to the customer about it. I've told a couple people say they will tip in the app only to never tip, and although these customers I understand are very likely to just be lying, it does add to me wondering if PostMates skims off the top of our tips sometimes.
I really appreciate any tip, high or low, but I wonder if there would be some way to verify if the $4.65 cent tip I got on a exactly $30.00 order is really what the customer tipped. I myself when going out, tip in whole dollar amounts ($4.00, $5.00, $6.00, etc), or I tip in a way that my total amount is even ($24.60 bill so I tip $5.40 for a final total of $30.00, for example).

I stand to lose 80 cents to 2 dollars Per Delivery despite Fare Increase.,"On May 21st 2018 the fares in my city increased. According to the app notification I was going to ""on average Delivery fares will increase 1.2x."" [https://imgur.com/a/VRLWPes](https://imgur.com/a/VRLWPes)
I was a tad worried with this increase but I figured they would lower boost and promotions as a result. For ever .1 it is 40 cents. With the increase in fares I have seen a .2\-.4 drop in boost. I will make at least .80 cent less despite the increase in fares because we have a min fare of 4 dollars in my city. That means despite the pay increase, I will be making 10\-20 percent less money then I was before on most deliveries because most deliveries are within the 4 min fare distance (2.3ish miles). 2.3 miles \* 1.10= 2.53\*.35(uber takes 35 percent)=.89 cents. 2.53\-.89 1.64
1.64\+1.88(New pick up fee after fee)\+.88 (new drop off fee after fee.)=4.4(1.3x)= 5.72. I earned 5.72 cent on that delivery Now with the old boost and lower base rate fare.
2.3(.9)=2.07(.35)=.72 cents. 2.07\-.72=1.35
1.35\+1.56(Old pickup fee before)\+.71(old drop odd.)=3.62 Which is lower then min fare so they add a .38 cents. 3.62\+.38=4(1.6 old boost for weekdays)=6.40 cents
Even though my old fare was less because of the boosts I see a .68 cent difference in fare. On top of this Promotions have lowered as well. For me, I also looked at promotions adding to the fare of each delivery. So when it was 5 deliveries for 10 dollars (and 10 deliveries for 20), I felt like that was adding 2 dollars per delivery. They have dropped the promotions in my city. 5 for 9 and 8 for 15. These do change all of the time and have since I started but they normally were about the same and didn't effect overall earnings to much. Some times I would see a pretty good one (Low requirement for a decent payout.) Now with the slight change in when promotions pay and the amount it just adds to making less. with 5 for 9. that is only an extra 1.80 per delivery. If I take into account the .68 cents I already lost I can add another 20 cents to that. Which means for deliveries within a promotion day I am making .88 cent less. The more deliveries I take the less I will make because when promotions pay out. The highest promotions are for less deliveries and pay less. So even if I do get a chance to take 23 deliveries I will make less money. I touch on driving time later on.
While they may not have to institute a requirement to hit the min fare as often, I am still making less because the boost have dropped so much. When it comes to deliveries within the min fare, it is exactly .40 per .1 that drops on the boost. So on those really quick deliveries that are only a mile or 2 miles away, on weekdays for example, i will make 5.6 instead of 6.40. Now, on longer deliveries I will see a slight increase on deliveries but now I am dealing with delivery driving time against max possible deliveries in that 12 hours. I average about 2 deliveries per hour, on busy nights (which it has been busy lately because many drivers aren't driving because of this change) I get about 3\-4. But since short deliveries now pay much less, I will try to shoot for longer delivers which means less chance of hitting higher level promotions which means less money. So as a driver I have to figure out how to take longer delivers while still trying to fit 3\-4 in an hour to hit promotions. I can't just create time. This also limits who I can pick up from. I didn't have a problem with Mcdonald's before because I could pump out deliveries like a machine gun but now? Mcdonald's is a restaurant I have to screen because I will make less money on those deliveries I was before. but the problem is (I would estimate) 30 percent of all my deliveries are from Mcdonald's. I have to figure out how to account for that. But I can't create orders for different locations. No matter what area I am there are at least 2 to 3 Mcdonald's in the are because this is America and people need them as much they need a Starbucks ever mile. I know acceptance rates don't matter but trying to screen them when they are the same distance from me as other restaurants will be very challenging. I have to travel at least 2.7 miles or more to see almost the same earning as I was before. What is frustrating about that is last week I took 17 deliveries for a total of 46 miles (miles I was paid for.) that is on average 2.7 miles per Delivery. The fare increase and drop in everything else have completely canceled things out to the point of trying to figure out how to prevent the lose in pay while still taking longer deliveries. I couldn't imagine how people who delivery downtown feel. During lunch time, downtown can get pretty busy but many of the deliveries are pretty short distance because it is a lot of business people needing lunch and what not. It is the only advantage of working downtown. You can pump out a decent quantity within a short amount of time. But this is no longer financially beneficial. In order to maintain the same level of pay I also am more restricted from where I can pick up OR I have to work longer and delivery more in order to maintain the same level. Which I can't do because I am limited on how long I can drive. It's not even a matter of working harder. TL;DR. Increase fares. Said on average you will make 1.2x more. Lowered Boost and promotions. I make less. Have to drive longer, take longer delivers, to make the same amount of money. Can't because of drive time and can't create orders. Make less money despite a .95 ""increase"" in pay. Will edit because I am sure there are typos or could make something more clear.
Yes, run two apps, I do, I even signed up for DD as well. So grubhub/DD/Uber. I still like Uber more then Grubhub. Better everything.
I run eats because I have delivery experience and am good at the job. I know the area very well.

i guess what i'm getting at is, how common are orders like those? i realize there are a huge number of factors in play here that make it hard to give even a rough estimate, but in YOUR experience, how many/how often have you had to deal with heavy bulk orders like that? once a day, once a week? i have chronic back problems due to a congenital deformation in my spine (not visibly noticeable yet, but i'll have a Dowager's hump you could cross the Sahara on by the time i'm 45...) and countless work-related injuries throughout my life. i do plan on getting a collapsable handcart and crates as i've seen suggested in this sub, which will no doubt help me out a great deal. the thing is, i know there are going to be days every once in a while when my back pain will make it physically impossible for me to complete an order like that and i'm going to have no choice but to decline the order. i'm just afraid of racking up like, 5 RIs in a month and getting booted right away. other than that, IC seems like a very good fit for my needs and lifestyle so i'm really hoping it's not a case of ""maybe it's just not the right job for me."" i will also have at least 1-2 other platforms like Postmates to fall back on in case i'm unable to work as many IC hours as i'd like. whew, sorry for the long winded post, guess i just have some n00b jitters to work off. but thanks for taking the time to read if you made it to the end, and any other tips or suggestions for a rookie are welcome. thanks guys!","it depends but you will get them. for me i rarely see them now a days but there was a point where it was common to see them once a week at least. for instance last week there was one day where everyone of my orders had at least one heavy item such as a 20 pound bag of rice or petfood, 10-20 pound bag of ice, or two cases of water. if your in a zone that has DO expect to see them constantly as it is common to see everyone passing up 20 cases of water from costco and they send it to you to see if you'll be the idiot who takes it when no one else wants it.
there was a point where customers would order more than one case of water and i would just grab one and tell the customer that was all they had just so i wouldn't have to do extra lifting. now a days i have a heavy dolly that folds side ways that makes it easy to haul 3 cases of water with ease so i don't mind.
so my suggestion is to either get a dolly to make things easier for you or to limit the heavy items to one per item or don't work on the platform.",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/6uiibq/newb_concerns_re_mild_physical_disability_heavy/,InstacartShoppers,disability,6uiibq,2017-08-18,1,9,prettyinacasket,1,"health restrictions, suitability, advice",both,1,heavy orders,neutral,Agree,1,DISAGREEMENT,neutral,,,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I can‚Äôt drive for a profession any longer,"I have been an Uber driver (and Lyft driver off and on) for over 4 years, but tonight, I‚Äôm going to have to call it. I can not do it anymore.
In the last 3 years I have driven over 25,000 miles a year and maybe more in the first year of driving for Uber. That‚Äôs not counting miles off the clock driving my wife‚Äôs car that I have no record of. I am 50 years old this year so YMMV, but I have some serious nerve damage in my right foot, ankle and lower leg from all the long days and nights of driving. I haven‚Äôt been checked out yet to see how bad the damage is but it has gotten so bad I‚Äôm going to have to throw in the towel. I only did 4 short rides today and started to loose the feeling in my lower leg down to my foot. It‚Äôs like a burning sensation that‚Äôs also numbing and tingling. I guess it‚Äôs like carpal tunnel of the leg/foot, better know as drivers foot?
The first sign of this damage started probably back about three years ago when Uber had some nice guarantees going on that made you want to drive as much as possible throughout the week/month to maximize the bonus. Fortunately for me those bonuses disappeared and so did the problem in my lower leg or I might‚Äôve had to quit back then. But over the years with the continuous from break peddle to gas to break all day long doing it full-time, the damage has gotten so severe I am going to have to throw in the towel. If I go any longer I will do some serious serious damage if I haven‚Äôt already. I am writing this to let all drivers know what is to come doing this full time for many years but also I am looking for any information on what I can do legally. I live in California. Is there any way of getting workmen‚Äôs Comp., disability, or something that I have not thought of? Also I am an Uber select driver with a 5 series BMW and a hefty monthly payment I will not be able to afford after quitting. What do I do with this car I won‚Äôt be able to afford? I can‚Äôt trade it in or sell it since I‚Äôm upside down in it at the moment and maybe for a few more years. I am so screwed so any help would be very appreciative.
I actually enjoy driving and that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôve done it for so long and dealt with the pains over the years but it has gotten so bad of late that I cannot do it any longer. I blame Uber for the damages and you wouldn‚Äôt know why I say this if you haven‚Äôt driven back when I started 4 years ago. Shortly after I started they lowered the rates on us, took away incentives, and eventually added these guarantees that wanted you to drive many hours a week to maximize the bonus to just get close to what our pay used to be. I was driving like a madman day and night to maximize the bonus‚Ä¶ And then the damage was done to my leg/foot.
To minimize any further damage over the years I have gotten really good with the cruise control, controlling the speed from the steering wheel, like a gaming controller, but that can only go so far. Short rides are the killer. There‚Äôs really no way to use the cruise control on short trips. So it must end now.
Should I get a lawyer? Does anybody have a good lawyer to talk to? What else can I do? Where do I go from here? This is crazy that I‚Äôm even typing this. I hope nobody else goes through this but it‚Äôs probably inevitable if you drive for a living and get up there in years?
Thanks for listening and for any tips/help?",">I was driving like a madman day and night to maximize the bonus‚Ä¶ And then the damage was done to my leg/foot.

Banned from Upwork after called names for my disability,"I'm writing because I really need some help or advice.
I have type 1 bipolar disorder and I'm a drug and alcohol addict of 20 years. I've been living in sobriety / recovery for the last 15 months and the only job I've been able to hold down is as a freelancer on Upwork.
This week, I hired someone on Upwork to help me with some website work (for my mental health website where I help others) and the person I hired called me names when I asked for edits he didn't like. I fired him. Then he started taunting me by making comments about how he feels sorry for how bad my life is and my mental health. So I said some rude things to him.
When you struggle with mood disorders like mine, it's really hard sometimes to keep cool when that happens. I wasn't expecting to be taunted, and provoked like that and I responded poorly. But I was provoked about my disability that I can‚Äôt control sometimes.
I said nothing racist, nothing discriminatory, but then I got an email from Upwork saying I did something racist or discriminatory and I was banned forever from Upwork. My response to him telling me I had a terrible life because of my disease was to tell him he lives in a third world country. He later said a lot of things that didn‚Äôt make sense and I told him that his Upwork profile says he is fluent in English but that I can‚Äôt understand what he‚Äôs saying. I didn't handle it well, but I did NOT start this and I did NOT say anything racist as ‚ÄúJast‚Äù in Upwork support claims. It's really hard making it in this world when you have to overcome mental illness and addiction and I really need a chance to have a second chance to feed my kids with this job on Upwork.","So basically you and the freelancer said dumb shit in Upwork's message rooms and you both got the axe.

Starting Lyft tomorrow and I have a couple questions for drivers with disabilities,"Hey all! So, I have a couple questions that I can't really find answers to anywhere online:
1. I have an anxiety disorder that makes driving sometimes a little difficult for me, but it's substantially improved by using audio navigation through Google Maps. Are Lyft drivers allowed to put on audio navigation during drives? Is it a party foul that will land me with bad reviews?
2. I have Intraocular melanoma (eye cancer) that makes me very light sensitive and I need to wear sunglasses pretty much every time I'm outside. When I thought about it, I don't remember ever having a Lyft driver that wore sunglasses. Is this considered rude or am I overthinking?
Thanks for any responses!",">Are Lyft drivers allowed to put on audio navigation during drives?

Is Flex Utility an allowed app? Is anything allowed in Android to help with swiping?,"I have muscular issues that cause problems with repetitive motion. This wasn't a problem flexing until recently, as now the rate of speed which I must tap/swipe in order to grab blocks causes me physical problems and I'm having an increasingly difficult time grabbing blocks. An iPhone user fellow driver showed me the workaround using accessibility custom gestures in the iPhone settings, but we don't have that on Android. I feel there is disability discrimination happening at this point, and that there should be a compromise allowed for some sort of simple script that at least allows me to tap anywhere on the screen and have it count as a swipe, like the iPhone users have.

"Hold up. Of course, I shoulda known better...","I'm a little upset, this got far more rambling and incoherent than I intended. But fuckin hell. It shouldn't be this hard. Not sure what I'm gonna do. Get blitzed outta my fuckin mind, depressed sleep 18 hours away, go for round 2,354., Walk into traffic. Deliver tired as fuck. Don't even know if I'm gonna call to check if GrubHub or Postmates package shit has arrivederci yet.
TLDR: UberEats went from a ""I'm only homeless for as long as I want to be homeless. It's completely up to me if i build the ladder to get out of this hole. The woods all here "" HOW DARE YOU HAVE BOOTSTRAPS"" in 3 seconds last night. My most profitable hours got stripped, for 6 hours, then they are going to add 4-5+ more hours to it cause NOW, after the break is up, I'm tired and want to sleep. Now I have to be homeless weeks longer cause some motherfuckin dumbass can't check his ego and decides to go way to long without being real with himself and do dumb shit.
They say to work hard and pull yourself up, then you try and do exactly that and get what can only be punishment and attempts to stop it thrown at ya. I live in my car. How do I solve this? Get money. I have a car. I can use car for money. Other people have money. Other people want shit, but don't have car to get it with. I use my car to bring them that shit, they give me money. Fuckin Perfect! Motherfuckers always wanting shit at all times of day and night too. I can sleep when people don't want shit to be fetched. I can do this shit day and night and knock some shit that needs knocking out, out real quick. Nope, you are not allowed to make money for 6 hours. It's for your safety. We're gonna force you to not work when you're not tired so that you start considering working when you are tired enough to have stopped otherwise and sleep ... for your safety. That's why it took me 22 hours to work 12 hours. Ihad so much good damn free time not working, I could slept if I wanted to be fucking sleeping. So youre gonna tell me I NEED a 6 hour break when I had 10 hours of fuckin break over the day. If I was tired I had PLENTY of opportunity to sleep. And not only THAT, you treat us just like employees when it's beneficial, and independent contractors when it doesn't. IF YOU ARE NOT GONNA PUT A MINIMUM WAGE INTO PLACE, DO NOT FUCKIN LIMIT MY HOURS. You're THAT asshole? I can make so little I can't survive, but do not fuckin make to much, well cap that shit. You want me to be an independent contractor? I make my own damn schedule then.
I'm forced 6 hours of lost income, at the highest boost rating over next days, during the one time period I actually can expect trips, cause probably nobody else is even working. What did they actually do? I'm only 27+ hours without sleep now, not refreshed and ready. Im now, once the break is starting to be done, tired enough to say Ima drive my fuckin car through their front door and not sure if I'm gonna depressed sleep go find drugs and get fucked beyond repair or just fucking go for round 2,35 fuckin 4.. JK. I wouldn't do that. And not to fuckin mention had I made 30$ during that 6 hour period, I was only 1-1 1/2 days from affording gas, phone bill AND a week of having a shower with a damn curtain and a roof without a moonroof. It's now a 3-4 day clusterfuck, that'll just prob turn itself into 7+ when I try to get there. I'm frankly at this point depressed and done. I was nearly bout to transition to weekly living that fuckin quick too. Blinded by hope and and wishes and like always, tried to make the depression the bad guy. He at least tells me what's gonna fuck happen. Don't listen to him telling you it's gonna get fucked over, and over, and over. Two days prior I had to completely reset from ground zero cause a tire shredded on me and needed to be replaced. And before that nearly lost phone service before I could even get started, because they took their sweet ass time with the background check and fucked about with my first weekly taking three weeks to get to me and not having the gas to do a single damn thing other than go to a gas station to get more gas. but magic fuckin jellybeans on that shit solving Can shit just TRY not to completely unravel for a fuckin minute. I can't do shit when I have to keep dealing with that shit. Any progress gets punted back to the start over, and over.
Postmates, GrubHub and shit use the block system, and as a new driver i can only work what is left for me, not what I'm willing to work. So they'll probably try to fuck with me too and give 2 hours a week or only let you work 5-8 hours a day, and I bet they all fuckin link so you can't get around time limits by using another one.
I deal with some MASSIVE depression disorder issues, I deal with PTSD, BPD, anxiety. I just got issues glued together to look human. I spent an entire fuckin day thinking I was handling this homeless situation like a boss and was gonna end it quicklike and it was not a happy situation. I was doing everything I could. Every fuckin trip, over 21 hours straight, hours researching and asking questions on how to be better, and make more than I am, signing up with services and shit to help me get out of homelessness.
I challenged the depression, and like fuckin always got bitch slapped into the ground because of it. I can't fuckin win, ever, I swear to Jesus mother of flyin flipping Christ. What is it about me that attracts this shit? You're situation has a mediocre amount of hope? There's not enough shit raining down on you then. I must have it far to fuckin good or something. That can't be happening. Two days ago a tire shredded on me. It was 3 months old. A baby tire. Not a nail, not a pothole, the tire just simply went to shit itself. Shit I can't control attacks me way to fuckin much. It's seriously impressive just how often the shit is happening. Three times in one week shits gotta try and keep the situation how it is.
